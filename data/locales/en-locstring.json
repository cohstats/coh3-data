When you're able to, let me know where you are or heading to next.\\r\\n   This letter has been a long time coming. I asked Ma and Pa not to say anything in their letters to you for the last six months, as I wanted to be the first one to tell you. I passed my last flight check. I'm a ferrying pilot for the Women Airforce Service Pilots or WASP stationed out of Palm Springs. I get to help, like you.\\r\\n   By the time you receive this letter, I will have already completed my first assignment and could be anywhere in the US.\\r\\nLove, your sister,\\r\\nIda",

My Seabee battalion spent a lot of time cleaning up the mess the Germans left behind. We can't do anything until the mess is cleaned up.\\r\\n   None of us thought your hobby would be used in the war effort. We've supported your flying before, but the current dangers are too great.\\r\\n   The brothers and I thought you would stay home. We're all in this war so you can be safe.\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nTony",

It's great to hear you're back on land. Are you going to be helping build a base again?\\r\\n   You don't worry about me. I'm only ferrying planes in the US and Canada. There are dangerous jobs in the WASPs. One of my classmates is a tow target pilot. She flies with a target behind her while men on the ground shoot at it with live ammo. Her plane had a few holes in it when she lands but so far, no tow pilots have been injured.\\r\\n   By me and my friends flying, we're able to relieve men for combat, so you can come home sooner.\\r\\nLove, your sister,\\r\\nIda",

The Germans destroyed the infrastructure as they left. I'm currently trying to set up a water purification system.\\r\\n   If you ever get offered to be a tow pilot, turn it down. Most of the veterans here complain when a replacement is added to their unit. They believe the replacements are too green. Being in a place where a teen could shoot you down in training, would not be my ideal place for you.\\r\\n   Promise me! You won't fly overseas.\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nTony",

I am worried about you. The mail clerk here knows what I'm going to ask.

I might be your little sister but I'm not a kid anymore.\\r\\n   The WASPs don't ferry overseas. We only ferry from factory to deployment base and back. Our director was formerly part of the British Air Transport Auxiliary. She used to fly military planes from Canada to Scotland before the US joined the war.\\r\\n   When I was back in California, one of my friends was telling me about how she was helping train male pilots to fly the B-29 bomber. The boys are scared to fly it - the engine can catch fire - until they saw a WASP flying it. Couldn't let a girl outfly them. I'm not rated to fly the B-29, so don't worry.\\r\\n   Stay dry and warm.\\r\\nLove, your sister,\\r\\nIda",

When we were finished some of the pilots shared their mess with us as thanks. At least it was a hot meal.\\r\\n   Thank God you don't have the rating for the B-29. I still don't understand why you would want to or why you're allowed to fly military planes. They're not a place for a girl. If the boys are scared to fly it, it is with good reason.\\r\\n   You really should be at home with Ma and Pa. It must be hard to have their sons at war. Now to have their only daughter flying all over the damn country. You should be home with them.\\r\\n   Give up this foolishness and return home where you belong.\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nTony",
  "11216913": "26 Nov\\r\\n\\r\\nDear Ida,\\r\\n   I shared your last letter with the injured pilot. He did his instrument training with a WASP. He could understand your letter better than I could. I watched him go from being scared to wanting to fly again.\\r\\n   I don't really understand, but he did say something. ''Laying here in this bed and hearing planes overhead. I ached to be back in the sky. Being grounded feels like I'm dying.'' The pain in his voice was hard to hear and I know I couldn't take it if you said it. You won't hear another word out of me on this.\\r\\n   I'm leaving Italy in a few days. My battalion is heading for England. I'll send you another letter when I arrive there.\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nTony",

I haven't made this decision lightly and I know it isn't what you want. This is something I want to do. Please don't be mad at me.\\r\\n   I can't sit at home with Ma and Pa when there is this calling. After the shock and fear left, I wanted nothing more than to fly again. I wanted to be above the clouds, going cross country and watch the land change.\\r\\n   I hope your friend heals well and wasn't too injured.\\r\\n   When you return, I'll take you flying. Maybe you'll understand what I get out of it.\\r\\nLove, your sister,\\r\\nIda",

I couldn't respond to them because I had to make an emergency landing part way through my last flight. The engine on the plane started to smoke. I had to land at Clovis Army Air Field. I couldn't jump when I noticed the issue. The parachute I was given was sized for men, so it was too big. My only option was to try and land the plane.\\r\\n   The landing was rough, and I was injured. I didn't get your letters until I returned to base.\\r\\n   I'm still at base - grounded - but the landing scared me, and the severity of my injuries have me wondering if you were right. Maybe I should go home. I wish you were here right now.\\r\\n   What have you been working on lately?\\r\\nLove, your sister,\\r\\nIda",

You need to really think what that would do to Ma and Pa.\\r\\n   You're supposed to be the safe one. I don't want to get a letter saying you died while I'm on the battlefield. Go home. Being grounded is a good thing.\\r\\n   I've been helping with the construction of a hospital. So far it has been going alright. We're not going to beat any records this time. I've been talking with a couple pilots I ate with a while ago, who have been injured, one of them from a bad landing. He says it was one of the scariest things he's experienced. He's happy to be grounded.\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nTony",

Strange how you can live in a place all your life and not realize how beautiful it is. Of course, I didn't realize how much sand the ghibli would leave in my teeth, either. It's not all glamour out here.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I spotted German tanks on the horizon when I went up the hill to sketch this morning. Our commander warned us that it won't be long before they attack. I won't lie to you, I'm nervous. I hope our training pays off. We have to show them that we won't take tyranny lying down.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217405": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Well, the fighting has finally stopped. We traded fire for a while before we saw that we were outgunned and had to retreat. Thankfully, I'm not hurt. A few of the others have taken minor injuries, but we're mainly shaken up. You think everything they taught you in training has prepared you for war until you're actually in it.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Do me a favor and don't tell our other friends, all right? I don't want to discourage them. I'm sure Omar has already been making up stories about me punching Germans and riding tanks with the wind in my hair. We'll need that kind of spirit if we want to take our country back after all this is over.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217406": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Well, our commander was right. The Germans did attack. It's a good thing we saw them coming, because we had enough time to prepare and drive them off. It's strange - it felt like an eternity while I was in it, and yet, looking back, it was all over so quickly. I'm sure as soon as you tell our other friends that we won, Omar will say I'm being modest and insist I punched one in the face.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Being here is unlike anything I've ever done before. It's not even like training. But I think it'll be good for me. I doubt the Italian colonists will go peacefully when we demand our independence from them, and if some of us have combat experience, we'll be ready.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217407": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   It's good to hear your manuscript is going well. So is my art, oddly enough. I'm grateful you gave me that notebook. Sometimes, when we stop, I sketch the ruins around us and imagine the soldiers that came through here centuries ago.\\r\\n\\r\\n   The days are getting longer, and so are the marches. It was slow going until we captured some tanks in a camp near Ajdabiya yesterday. The unit accompanying us chased the Italians out in minutes, and while we got the engines running, they grabbed the camp's supplies.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Between you and me, I wonder what it'll be like when the Italians are gone. Will the British take our supplies, too? I guess there's only one way to find out.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217408": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   It looks like the Germans weren't too happy about us taking their allies' tanks. As soon as we made it back to the main road, they came out of nowhere and pinned my unit down. When we tried to escape, their tanks drove around and flanked us from the side. We barely knew which way to run, let alone which way to shoot.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Everyone in my unit was able to get away, but I've heard one of the other armoured divisions wasn't so lucky. Our commander feels that the way the Germans cornered us was a dirty trick, and I can't say I disagree with him. How can you fight an enemy that doesn't even respect you enough to play fair?\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217409": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Tell Fatima and Sayid to stop worrying about me. I'm fine. Well, disoriented and hungry. The point is, I'm alive. This afternoon, the Germans attacked us from the front and tried to pin us while their tanks snuck up from the side. Because we had our own tanks, we were able to return their fire. We may only have held the line, but it's a damn good start.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Some of the others in my unit are less convinced. They keep fretting that they've never seen tactics like that before. It's not complicated to me. If the British have any brains, they'll press the advantage and keep hounding them. We can't give the Germans a chance to play any more tricks on us.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217410": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sorry I don't have any exciting news to report. We were getting close to the Gazala line when things ground to a halt. The Germans have carpeted the entire stretch of desert between us with mines, so no one can advance. We just sit here and stare all day. It wouldn't be so bad if I had any time to draw, but I know that as soon as one of us lets our guard down, they'll attack.\\r\\n\\r\\n   To tell you the truth, I think they're holing up over there because they're afraid of us. Where's this \"blitzkrieg\" that's supposed to strike terror into our hearts? I wish they'd get on with it. Then maybe we can move on from this place.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217411": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I spoke too soon. Just after sunrise yesterday, we woke up to the most terrible roar we'd ever heard. When the dust cleared, I swear there were hundreds of vehicles charging at us. We could only fight for a few minutes before we had to abandon our box. It wasn't just us, either. We keep getting reports of other units being overwhelmed. How could we have ever held our own against that?\\r\\n\\r\\n   Our commander told us the Americans may give us some tanks soon. It's about time. We can't keep letting the Germans get away with this. The next time they come for us, I'm not holding back. If force is the only language they speak, we need to hit them twice as hard.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217412": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Today has been a whirlwind. I'm not even sure where to start. We woke up to a horrible dust cloud and a wall of German tanks. We had to abandon our defenses, but just when we thought all was lost, an armoured division showed up with American tanks and scared them off. The Germans turned tail and started fighting backward toward their supply lines. That's the trouble with relying on the element of surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I knew they weren't as impenetrable as they made themselves out to be. They're getting overconfident, and that will be their downfall. The next time they show up, we're going to teach them a lesson in humility. Who knows? Maybe it'll remind the British whose desert this is, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217413": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I don't see why my last letter made you so upset. I've been nothing but honest with you about what it's like out here. How can I think about drawing ruins when the Germans are shelling them as we speak? How did we sit around in that coffee shop and daydream about revolution while the Italians were burning the countryside? We were so naive. We should have known we were never going to win this with words.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Our commander has identified more German units heading toward Tobruk. Trying to finish the job, I imagine. Not if I have anything to say about it. If any of our other friends think I'm not myself anymore, they're welcome to come fight with me. Then they'll understand.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217414": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sorry to have gone so long without writing. I'm not sure how to say this, so maybe I'd better just get it down. Two weeks ago, the Germans ambushed us outside of Madinat Bayad. An artillery blast threw me against a tank. I've broken a dozen bones in my hand. I've asked three different doctors when I'll be able to draw again, and they say, \"Just focus on getting better.\" I know they're avoiding me.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Asma, how could I have been so foolish? I put the thing I valued most on the line, and for what? I haven't changed anything. I don't even know if the British are grateful for us. I'm asking you, genuinely. Where did I go wrong?\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217415": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sorry for taking this long to respond. The Germans ambushed us near Madinat Bayad two weeks ago. The last thing I remember is being thrown against a tank. I woke up in a field hospital, and I've been here ever since. The doctor said we won the battle, but when I asked him why my arm was in a cast, he said I'd broken a dozen bones in my hand.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I don't know what to do. What if I can't draw once it heals? How could I have been foolish enough to put that on the line? I was so convinced I was going to change this war for the better. No one does. No matter what we win, there's always something lost.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217416": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Thank you so much for your last letter. It took courage to be as honest with me as you were. You're right. You always are. When you're fighting just to survive, it's easy to lose sight of what you really believe in. I don't know what I've done to deserve a friend like you, but I've been through too much to question it.\\r\\n\\r\\n   The nurses have given me paper, and I've got nothing but time, so I'm going to teach myself how to draw with my left hand. When you love something, you've got to fight for it. In the meantime, I hear my unit is about to head into action again. I wish them well. And, Asma - I wish you well, too.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217417": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I heard over the radio this evening that my unit had to retreat. I guess I should be disappointed, yet somehow, I'm not. I know we've turned the tide. I know the Germans are limping toward El Alamein. We did that. And if we have to face the British, we'll do it with our heads high, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'll keep your secret about finishing your manuscript if you promise to keep one for me. This morning, I felt a twinge in my fingers, and I was almost able to make a fist. I want to surprise the others when I get back. I'm not sure when that will be, so keep my usual chair open. I can't wait to see everyone again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",
  "11217418": "Asma,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I just heard on the radio that my unit held the Germans off. We've done it. We're finally wearing them down. I've been told that they're making a last-ditch push for El Alamein. If we beat them there, I think we'll kick them out for good. I know we're still a far cry from the fight that we hoped for, but in the meantime, I'm content to take our victories in this one.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I know you can keep a secret, so I'll admit this to you. This morning, I had a twinge in my fingers, and I could almost make a fist. I don't want anyone to get too excited, and I'm not superstitious, but somehow, I'm starting to feel like we have better days ahead.\\r\\n\\r\\nAbdul",

  "11219013": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Finally here in Italy, so I can write again. Now that we're miles from our landing point, I'll tell you how it went. We didn't want the enemy to know that we'd arrived, so we snuck onto a remote beach in the middle of the night. We had to make our way up the sand by moonlight, and any footstep we heard could've been the enemy. Talk about trusting the man next to you.\\r\\n\\r\\n   How are Iain and Brendan doing? I can already see them arguing over that officer's hunting knife I sent. I'd tell them to be careful with it, but I remember being their age. Feels strange to say that. Out here, it seems like a lifetime ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite soon!\\r\\nClive",
  "11219014": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Have I got a story for you. The boys and I happened upon a German observation post today. When we saw they had comm equipment, we smelled opportunity, and we ducked into the bushes to cook up a plan. Most of the unit charged in from the front and kept them busy, while Lt. MacNeill and I snuck into the camp and raided it. We made out like bandits! We know all about where the enemy's headed for the next two weeks.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Huge congratulations to Iain for winning that bicycle in the essay contest. I thought they'd melted them all down to make bullets. Tell him to ride fast and have fun. That's the sort of thing I would've killed to have at his age.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite soon,\\r\\nClive",
  "11219015": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Sometimes I think a near-victory is worse than an outright defeat. The boys and I came across an observation post today. We weren't sure what they had inside, but we knew we wanted it. MacNeill and I snuck in while the others distracted them - I mean, right under their noses! - but we only found a map. We had to fall back before we could dig for anything else. They know we've got it, so they'll probably change their plans now anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n   At least Iain won that bicycle in the essay contest, so one of us is having a good week. Maybe when I come to visit, he'll feel sorry for me and let me have a turn on it out of pity.\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite soon,\\r\\nClive",
  "11219016": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Of course everything happened exactly the way I wrote it. We're fighting to save the world here. That's not the sort of thing you tell tall tales about. The boys and I are the ones they send in to do the tricky stuff that the newsreels aren't allowed to report on. You'll see! We just have to win first.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Anyway, happy to hear everyone is doing fine. A bookkeeping job at the shipyard? Well done, you. You'll make your first million before you know it.

  "11219017": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   How's this for the history books? I got to question a real-live German officer today. I captured a unit commander at the end of our last raid, so the boys gave me the honor of putting the screws on him. Well, really, it was me and Sgt. Cooke. But all I had to do was give him a cool, intimidating stare, and he sang like Vera Lynn. Thanks to him, we know there's a fuel cache not far up the road. Would've walked right past it. That should help us pick up the pace.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'd say more, but, you know. National security.

If we could capture the enemy commander, surely he'd know something! I dove in with bullets flying left and right, but he got away.\\r\\n\\r\\n   It's all right. We'll try again next time. Tell Brendan and Iain that Lt. Clive Masters never lets Jerry get away for long. Oh, and while you're at it, tell them to stop thumping each other. Is it always like that with brothers?

A few hours later, we heard that units were headed our way, so I pretended to be their superior officer. I told them we were fleeing south. They actually went for it and split up! We only had to fight half their forces. MacNeill still can't believe we pulled it off.\\r\\n\\r\\n   You see? It's not all about dropping bombs and dodging bullets. They always need fresh minds in diplomacy or cryptography. I bet Brendan would be a dab hand at languages if he put his mind to it.

Yesterday, we found an abandoned German radio, which was terrific until we heard that forces were coming our way. I pretended to be their superior officer and radioed them to fall back. They even believed it! But as we tried to slip off, a scout patrol spotted us. We ended up fighting them all anyway. Lost a fair bit of ground, too.\\r\\n\\r\\n   So I may have made a hash of that, but see? There's plenty Brendan can do without picking up a gun. With any luck, he'd be better at it than me.

  "11219027": "Dear Shelagh,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Yes, I speak German. Did I not tell you that? I could've sworn I did at some point. That's part of why they sent me here. When I volunteered, they saw that I was good with languages, and they told me they needed my skills for something more unique. That's why I spent so long at the base down the road from your house. They weren't sure what they'd need my unit for, so we had to learn a bit of everything.\\r\\n\\r\\n   You know, a lot of girls would find it exciting to write to a soldier with an element of mystery to him.

What, you didn't think I was saving Italy by myself, did you?\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm only joking. I know how my letters sound sometimes. You probably have all kinds of questions. I would if I were in your shoes. It's just as I've always said - I'm not sure how much I can talk about without compromising my job.

They're not going to squeeze a word out of me.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sure you're expecting me to say that I fought my way out with nothing but a metal file and verve.

I enlisted, they sent me to Scotland for training, and you know the rest.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sorry I lied. They made us create English cover stories to protect ourselves, but it sounds like I'll be risking my life soon anyway. I hope you believe me when I say that everything else I've written was true.

I'll have to continue going by Clive and keep my story up, but it's enough that you know. It didn't feel right to keep it from you anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n   More good news: our last operation was a resounding success. I'll be back before you know it if we keep this up.

It means the world that your family has been so kind to me, even if they were too polite to say anything. Your mum must've given Iain and Brendan a stern talking-to about it.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've heard rumblings from the higher-ups that they may need men like me to keep working once the war is over. Still top-secret, of course. That means I'll have to keep going by Clive, and I'm afraid I don't know when I'll return. As soon as I can get away and visit you, I will.

  "11219033": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Met the units they sent in from Camp Shelby this morning. It's good to see some faces that look like they've had enough sleep. My initial exam tells me they're well-trained, corn-fed, and have a clean bill of health. I'm not a gambling man, but I like our odds with them in tow.\\r\\n\\r\\n   If they're building our numbers back up, things are about to get hot again. Don't worry about me. I've made it this far. Just keep doing what you do best. Who knows? Maybe the rifleman whose arm you save will be the one who pulls me out of the fire.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219034": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   My instincts were right. As soon as we hit the road, the Krauts ambushed us. With the new recruits on hand, we gave them the whooping of a lifetime. Fascists - hate to see them, love to watch them run away.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Private McCall thought he'd be a hero and take three on at once, and got a shot in the leg for his trouble. Missed his femoral artery by an inch. Luckily, I got to him in time, so he's stable enough to brag about it. He said that he'd heard the local partisan girls like men with scars. I told him with a mug like his, he'll need all the help he can get.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219035": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I was right to trust my gut. The Krauts ambushed us on our way out this morning. We had to retreat to the hills. None of the new recruits have eyes in the back of their head yet. It's not their fault. I didn't when I landed in Sicily, either.\\r\\n\\r\\n   All of us old-timers got away unscathed, but Private McCall took a shot in the leg. Missed his femoral artery by less than an inch. Tough luck on your first day out. I made it to him in time, so he's stable enough to feel sorry for himself. He'll have to learn that that hero stuff only works in Caleb Callahan movies. Here, you fight to survive.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours in one piece,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219036": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Happy to say McCall's leg is healing fine. He's having a hard time with the C-rations, though. So are most of the new guys. Private Dodd says he used to like stew, but if anyone makes him eat it when he gets home, he'll kill them.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Rendezvoused with a sapper unit this morning. They've been scouting the bridges for mines. Two of them picked up malaria in Tunisia. They're too shaky to hold their guns. I thought I'd be dealing with head lice and upset stomachs, not that. I'd better try to scare up some quinine before we see action again. Maybe if we're lucky, we'll find some gin in the next town we liberate. Then we can really have a party.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219037": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Looks like our new friends were scouting in the right place. The sappers did find mines, and we got the drop on the squad that was laying them. The only casualty was Dodd's helmet. A sniper shot it off on their retreat. It's a good thing, because last I checked, we were almost sixty miles away from the nearest evacuation hospital.\\r\\n\\r\\n   Good news on the quinine front, too - we found a shipping truck in a ditch with tonic water, stockings, and lipstick. That's a king's ransom out here. Even had Theatrical Red, your favorite. I've sent you a tube with this letter. Figured you didn't have many creature comforts these days. Wear it and think of me.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219038": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Well, I'll have my work cut out for me tonight. Dodd got his bell rung by a mortar, and another one broke Richards' ankle. He'll live, but the break's too complicated for me to set. Going to be interesting getting him to the evacuation hospital. It's almost a hundred miles away. Could I trouble the Fifth Army surgeon to build another one, or what? We're not fighting on the beachhead anymore.\\r\\n\\r\\n   McCall's been giving me grief about looking forward to mail call every day. I told him if he could manage to impress any of the partisan girls, he'd be doing the same thing. Besides, he doesn't have you, so who's the real winner here? You're an angel for putting up with my complaining.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219039": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Did you get the last letter I sent? The rain has been torrential over here. Not sure the mail is going through. The rivers have swelled and washed the roads out, which means we're wading half the time, which means trench foot. I've treated four early cases this week. They'll be fine, but what is this, Verdun?\\r\\n\\r\\n   Every few days, the brass promises us another field hospital. I don't see how they can follow through until the storm is over. If you were in charge, we'd've had ten lined up from Salerno to the Gustav Line before the skies were even cloudy. Of course, if you were in charge, Germany would surrender by Christmas.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219040": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Boy, was your latest letter a sight for sore eyes. I was getting worried that something had happened to you. The rain finally stopped on Monday morning, so we've been able to cover some ground. It's been good for the guys' morale. I could tell the mud was getting to them. In my experience, most men have simple principles. They'll fight for freedom, but they'll fight like hell to take a shower again.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm glad I can be honest with you about how things are out here. You know it's not like the newsreels. Don't let the doctors push you around, all right? You could do their job any day. The only reason you aren't is because of a dumb university quota. Remember that.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219041": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Boy, am I glad to hear from you. It's been another long week. The rain stopped on Monday morning, and within hours, the Krauts were on us again. With the mud in our guns, we couldn't shoot back, so we had to bail. On the retreat, Private Walsh slipped down a hill and broke his collarbone. Not hurt enough to evacuate, not well enough to help.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've heard some radio chatter about taking air bases, and I'm starting to wonder if that's the real reason why we're in Italy. They say we're all fighting the good fight, but it's not much of a fight when you're just keeping the enemy busy, is it? Guess that's why these decisions are above my pay grade.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219042": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Sorry it's been so long since I've written. We're in an area with sniper nests, so we have to stay on the move. It's getting cold at night, and between us, some of the guys' nerves are on edge. Corporal Jennings isn't sleeping well, and he's jumpy when he's awake.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm trying my damnedest here, but there's only so much I can do. I can't make it warmer. I can't make the shooting stop. I can't write to the brass for advice on the other problem, either, because the official line says they're homesick or losing sight of the cause. That's malarkey. I've never fought with a more dedicated unit. What do you think? Surely you've seen this kind of thing before.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219043": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I dare the surgeons at your hospital to beat the night I've had. I just removed a bullet under a blanket while McCall held up a flashlight. A few hours ago, we found ourselves in another scrap, and when Jennings ran out of ammo, he grabbed one of the enemy guns and rushed them. He got clipped in the shoulder, but he took their whole camp by himself.\\r\\n\\r\\n   The three of us are real good friends now, that's for sure. The guys have been joking about it ever since. I don't mind. It's nice to see them laugh again. Jennings especially. I owe him my life, even if I wish he hadn't taken the risk. How did I get stuck with all the daredevils?\\r\\n\\r\\nStill yours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219044": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Listen - you're the only person I'd trust this with. I just hid under a blanket and took a bullet out of Jennings' shoulder by flashlight. We got dragged into a night raid a few hours ago, and when our CO ordered a retreat, he stood there frozen. Only came around when he got hit. He's lucky to be alive. The injury will still take him out of the fight while he recovers. I get the feeling he needs it.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm going to tell our CO what you suggested. I appreciate you looking into it. Still, I hate that I had to rely on you for help. They're supposed to be relying on me. What good am I if I don't know this stuff?\\r\\n\\r\\nStill yours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219045": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Our CO took your advice about keeping the men on stricter shifts. Happy to report it's working. Jennings is feeling more like himself. On the flip side, we still can't evacuate anyone, and the aid stations are almost six miles apart around here. We've got to take whatever aid supplies we can carry and keep our fingers crossed. I'm this close to making moonshine to have some disinfectant again.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've been thinking a lot about when we met, and you told me that you admired a man who didn't need a gun to prove himself. It made me proud of my job. These days - I don't know. If I were half the medic you think I am, maybe I could do more for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill yours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219046": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   The strangest thing happened this week. I thought if I wrote it down, it might help me make sense of it. On Tuesday, we chased a squad down the mountain, and as I was examining Dodd's sprained wrist, a shot flew right past me. Before you worry, it missed. Just gave us all a good scare. McCall thinks it was an accident. Walsh isn't so sure.\\r\\n\\r\\n   At the risk of being an optimist - I know, me? - it got me thinking. If I didn't matter, the enemy wouldn't shoot at me. So you were right. Again. Let's face it, you always are. The bullet tore my red cross armband, and I'm going to keep it as a souvenir. Should remind me of what's important.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill yours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219047": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've been debating whether to tell you this, but no decent man lies to his girl. Besides, I figure you'd murder me if you heard it from someone else. We lost some ground on Tuesday, and a bullet nearly caught me on the ear as I was salvaging first aid kits. Walsh thinks the enemy may have done it on purpose. Shooting at a medic? That's low, even for them.\\r\\n\\r\\n   The longer I think about it, the more it eats at me. If they get me, who's going to change the guys' dressings or set their bones? Who's going to know typhus from hepatitis? I've got to hold the line for them. It's the least I can do. It's the least they deserve.\\r\\n\\r\\nStill yours,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219048": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I don't believe it. An entire field hospital platoon showed up today, armed with everything from plasma and atabrine to splints. They've set up more aid stations, and with the added manpower, we were able to pass all the wounded down the slopes.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've got an inkling that our forces are ramping up for something big. When you've been in the field as long as I have, you can smell it in the air. You always said I was better at writing about feelings than talking about them, so I want to tell you now that you've been invaluable to me. Whatever happens, I'm a better man for knowing you.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours always,\\r\\nHank",
  "11219049": "Ava,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I had to write as soon as I got the chance. We've finally cut through the enemy defensive line for good. They pinned us in a corner with gunfire, but when they threw a grenade, McCall picked it up like a baseball and threw it back. That crazy kid saved half the unit.

The point is, I did. And it amounted to something, like you said it would. Of all people, you'd understand what saving one life counts for.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours always,\\r\\nHank",

When I was pinned down and separated from the unit, McCall ran through a minefield five times to carry the injured guys back to me. Sure, the enemy held us off, but who cares? If you could bottle courage like that, I'd pay a million bucks for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n   I can't tell you when I'll be able to see you again. I can tell you that I finally feel like I've earned my keep. You asked me weeks ago where our unit would be if I hadn't patched McCall up. Just goes to show I should've listened sooner.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours always,\\r\\nHank",

The food is deplorable, and just when you think your feet can't take anymore, there's another mile yet to walk. I can't imagine how the soldiers have made do as long as they have. I'm made for stacks of books and soft vicarage armchairs, not this.\\r\\n   I imagine that the cold, foggy weather hasn't helped. I've never felt so far from Hawke's Bay. I keep thinking it ought to be warm this time of year. Write me back and let me know how everyone is doing. I hope the archdeacon isn't giving you too much trouble while I'm gone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219809": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   How wonderful that the Hargreaves have had a healthy girl. I'm sorry I'll miss the baptism, though I'm sure you'll do fine. Between us, I'll be sure to give extra thanks that they heeded your advice and called her Rebecca after all.\\r\\n   The unit is in good health and high spirits. Last night, they went on a river patrol and soundly repelled a German unit that they found along the way. There was never a moment's hesitation, nor doubt from any of them. Between this and their living conditions, I find myself humbled by their resolve. No one could face the long marches and enemy guns if they didn't believe in a purpose higher than themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219810": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Please pass on my congratulations to Jessie and Jacob. I'm sure you did a fine job officiating their wedding. Particularly disappointed that I missed Mrs. Ward's pavlova at the reception afterward. I know, not very saintly of me.\\r\\n   The men have been well, considering. Last night, they were ordered to take a river patrol. They expected it to be quiet, but an enemy squad had other ideas. The Germans put up a fearsome fight, and owing to the dark and lack of preparation, our unit had to retreat. If they were afraid at all, they didn't show it. I marvel at what must motivate them. Is it duty? Love of country? Honor? It has to be something greater than themselves.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219811": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   What I wouldn't have given for more training. I keep finding new ways to make a complete fool of myself. This evening, a man in an officer's uniform came to the building where we'd taken shelter. When he entered, I leaped up, saluted, and asked, \"What do you need, sir?\" Only thereafter did our medic inform me that as a Chaplain 4th Class, I outranked him. I could hear the men struggling not to laugh.\\r\\n   To tell you the truth, I envy them. They've all become such good friends, in the way that the fires of battle forge lifelong loyalties. I must seem like a usurper to them. I hope we can find some common ground in our time together.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219812": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm afraid my attempts to ingratiate myself are going about as well as you'd expect them to. Yesterday, the men finally recaptured a town that the Germans have been using as a base for weeks. I suggested they take shelter and reflect on their victory, but they plundered the trattoria's wine cellar and celebrated all night. Needless to say, we have a unit full of sore heads this morning.\\r\\n   I shouldn't be prudish. They fought hard to retake this town. They deserve whatever joy they can scrape together in times like these. Creature comforts must feel better than a promise they can't eat or drink. What would you say? Surely there must be some way to gain their confidence.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219813": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Just when I thought things were getting better, I've gone and made them worse. Yesterday, the men made a brave charge on an occupied town, but the Germans were too well-fortified, and they were forced to fall back. I tried to reassure them that the path of the righteous is always fraught with challenges, but they were in no mood to hear it.\\r\\n   The fact is, some of these men have fought for a long time, and they struggle to believe that God could still be here for them. I've seen so little of war, and still, I understand how they could question these things. What would you tell them? You've always had a touch with people who've lost their faith.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219814": "Ven. Archdeacon C. J. Fitzroyce,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I am outraged to hear that Curate Stephen Chibnall may be facing disciplinary action. From my understanding, the council petitioned your office after he gave a sermon defending the virtues of pacifism. Let me ask you, seriously: what do we do this for, if not peace? Certainly we must take up arms against fascism first, but does the Church not need people who will remind them of their ideals?\\r\\n   I would rather have discussed this with you in person, but the unit to which I am attached is currently on course toward the Apennines. I hope that you will consider my words with utmost care. Stephen is a good man. He deserves a chance to prove himself.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours faithfully,\\r\\nRev. Alexander Doyle",
  "11219815": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Send my well-wishes to the archdeacon. I appreciate that he's seen sense and decided not to pursue your case. I confess, I may have exchanged a few spirited words with him about it. I won't tell anyone if you don't.\\r\\n   The unit had a strong showing when the Germans showed up this week. Sadly, one of our young sergeants was still wounded toward the end. He's healing well, but he was terribly uncomfortable then, so I stayed up with him all night. He did most of the talking. I just listened, as you told me to. I see now that I have as much to learn from them as they do from me. I only wish I'd known it earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219816": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   It puts my mind at ease to know that the archdeacon has decided to leave you alone. When the Church values worldly politics over spreading kindness, we are never improved for it. I told him as much. I'm glad he took me seriously.\\r\\n   The men have had a trying week. One of our young sergeants was wounded badly in our last effort. He needed to be evacuated to a hospital, so I stayed with him all night until the convoy arrived. We talked about everything - his family in Wellington, his favorite rugby team. Or rather, he talked. I listened, as you told me to. Whatever these men believe, I think they benefit most from knowing that someone wishes for their recovery.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219817": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   If you could put in a good word with the Man Upstairs for my unit, I would appreciate it. I'm told that the men will be undertaking another offensive soon. I worry it may prove to be their most perilous venture yet. They seem cautiously optimistic about their plan, but I'm still not interested in leaving it to chance.\\r\\n   Our captain had me say grace before tonight's dinner, so I think I've weaseled my way into their good graces after all. It probably helps that I've figured out how to salute. I don't mind if I don't reach all of them. The point is to be a force for good. They could be roaring atheists, and I'd still be proud of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219818": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I believe your prayers paid off. We've had a Christmas miracle. The whole unit emerged unscathed, and just in time to celebrate. I gave a service while they trimmed a nearby tree with their bandoliers, sang carols, and hung their socks near the fire. As silly as it was, it brought us closer to home.\\r\\n   For all the mud and dubious rations, I've learned more in my weeks here that I would in a year back home. I've seen the desperation and strife that mankind is capable of, but also the incredible courage, and the unbreakable strength of spirit. If we are created in God's image, we can rest easy knowing that God is as righteous and loyal as these men.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",
  "11219819": "Dear Stephen,\\r\\n\\r\\n   A merry belated Christmas to you. It was an interesting feat trying to cobble one together here. We were in no position to have a proper service, but the men stuck their rifles together in the shape of a tree. Then we joked about the gifts we'd give each other. Between that and the news of victory elsewhere, I sense no one feels too poorly about our recent defeat.\\r\\n   The more I think about it, the more I believe something called me here. Perhaps God. Perhaps an urge to better myself. I see now that wherever we go and whatever hardships we endure, the human spirit persists. I'm grateful for the lesson. I hope it makes me a more compassionate teacher.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my best,\\r\\nAlexander",

The hillside capital has been settled since prehistory - the Etruscans and Samnites thrived there for centuries before the encroach of Rome. The traveller needs only one morning at the seaside to understand why the Victorians swore by \"taking the waters\" as the cure for their maladies. After a few hours, one cannot help but feel restored, as if the brisk salt air has scrubbed years off the careworn soul.\\r\\n   Small wonder, then, that in the 9th century, an obscure local monastery became the Schola Medica Salernitana, the world's first medical school. Many myths persist about it, from the tragedy of a crusader struck with a poisoned arrow to the miraculous recovery of a German prince. Perhaps there is something mystical about the place. After all, the remains of Saint Matthew himself rest in the crypt of Salerno Cathedral, watching over his domain.",
  "11221315": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Salerno offers such an embarrassment of geographical riches that some consideration must be spared for the way humans have tamed it. The aforementioned Schola Medica, not one to shy away from innovation, houses Europe's first botanical garden, the Giardino della Minerva. Atop the Colle Bellara at dawn, the lavender cityscape yawns into the Tyrrhenian tides as far as the eye can see. Salernitanos have built to carefully accentuate, the way a gardener respects the asymmetry of the rose.\\r\\n   In the last century, the vulgarities of modern industry imposed themselves upon this balance of manmade and natural beauty. By the 1870s, the city housed more than twenty textile mills, leading some to call it the \"Manchester of the Two Sicilies.\" Several of these lie in ruins now, as the sudden Allied invasion has recaptured the city in an explosive symphony. The economy will feel the loss eventually. The residents, however, concentrate on the days ahead. It could - as so often in these trying years - have been worse.",
  "11221316": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   What has not been said of Naples? It was the muse of Caravaggio, the seat of the Enlightenment, the birthplace of the Baroque. The grande dame of Campania is one of the oldest cities in the world, and with age has come a refinement unsurpassed in the region. It began as the colony of Parthenope, then witnessed the marriage of Greece and Rome. The arched Palazzo dello Spagnolo reflects its time under Aragon. It has been everything in its season: a duchy, a kingdom, the capital of a unified state. Naples - or \"Napoli\" to those who live there - will not be left behind.\\r\\n   After the tranquil beach and the pastoral hideaway, Naples stirs the blood, tempts the senses with its feast of sights and sounds. Music lovers will delight in opera at the Teatro San Carlo. For those still nature-inclined, the Villa Comunale - a former royal garden - provides an oasis of peace. Literary travellers may even find the final resting place of Virgil, the poet who brings glory to the city even in his repose.",
  "11221317": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Naples has undergone swift expansion in the past decades, thanks to the imperial aspirations of its head of state. Neapolitans cautiously weathered this change in the political wind, but when Germany approached from the north, they did not hesitate. They knew the stakes. If the jewel of the peninsula had attracted the Habsburgs and Bonapartes, it would be a prize for modern invaders as well. The bombing has proved more ferocious here than anywhere else in Italy - even now, explosions ring out as the Axis forces flee.\\r\\n   On the Via Benedetto Croce, the citizens have focused their efforts on the Church of Santa Chiara. The belfry and the tomb of Robert of Anjou have survived. The rest was less fortunate: a ten-day fire consumed most of the edifice. Residents, restorers, and monks vehemently disagree as to whether they should return it to its original Gothic state. Such friction is unsurprising. Naples defines itself by what it builds and rebuilds, in the colonnades and arches that reveal the city's soul.",
  "11221318": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Looking down from Potenza's ledges at the sprawling earth recalls the gods of Olympus gazing at the Grecian countryside. At a breathless 819 metres above sea level, it is one of Italy's highest regional seats, an eyrie of the Apennines. Below it, the long, serpentine Basento River courses through the hills and carves out a valley lush with life. On the ascent, a rare late-summer gust buffets the outcroppings, rattling the shutters and billowing the clotheslines like sails. This hostile geography has made it a challenge to attack - it has changed ruling hands many times, though seldom for long.\\r\\n   For those expecting a bustling capital, Potenza may seem sedate, with small churches and alleys too narrow for vehicles to traverse. Yet, after a day in its company, one realises that they have judged it too quickly. Its retiring countenance unfurls into the region's best-kept secret. The streets encourage a refreshing stroll, and the intimate cafes provide a reason to linger, if not overstay one's welcome.",
  "11221319": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Night falls over the Via Pretoria. Far from the lights of any metropolis, Potenza sits at the edge of the void, among the stars themselves. Then the distant buzz of a bomber engine cuts through the darkness, and one remembers that even this redoubt could not escape the war. Though the Allies' bombardment succeeded at driving the Axis out, much of the city lies in ruin. The residents have long, hard work ahead of them.\\r\\n   Either by a miracle or a stroke of incredible luck, the Teatro Francisco Stabile, the city's opera house, still stands. Those who moved here to flee the fighting grieve the losses. The locals, with their pails and shovels in hand, remain resolute. Potenza has been uprooted by the Longobards and Saracens, survived pillaging by the Angevins, rebelled against a king. They have tested their mettle against the mountainside itself. They build their spirits sturdy here. A few bombs will not topple them.",
  "11221320": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   On the opposite coast, Bari boasts a sanctity to rival Salerno's: it guards the relics of Saint Nicholas, the fabled giver of gifts. His basilica welcomes unmarried women, seafarers, and penitent thieves, and the rest of the city around him is no less colourful. From the top of the perimeter walls, the local districts fan out in a sumptuous display of sun-baked clay rooftops. In Bari Vecchia, frying polenta entices visitors toward the flea market to, perhaps, purchase a few gifts of their own.\\r\\n   But Saint Nicholas was originally of Myra, and Bari's place on the old trade roads has made it one of the Mediterranean's gateways to the East. The connection has proved a historic draw for Russian pilgrims, who inspired the Orthodox church in the Carrassi district. For a brief time, the city even housed an Islamic emirate - the sharp-eyed will find Arabic letters in Nicholas' resting place. Bari has seen the passage of Greeks, Romans, Turks, and Normans alike, and woven these influences into a tapestry all its own.",
  "11221321": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   The experienced traveller knows that to befriend a port city, one must walk through its harbor and see life as it truly is. Abandoning the comforts of mother tongues and familiar smells reveals Bari's beating heart, an agora of fast deals and sailors' cants. Here, the fishers advertise their catch from the back of their boats, vagrants play scopa, and stray dogs nip at the heels. The grandiose seafront that the state built in the past decade fails to impress them. The Barese brook no pretense.\\r\\n   At the time of writing, the bell tower is quiet. A burnished sunset descends upon the lungomare, and Bari's future remains uncertain. An unease hangs over the streets, an omen of trouble yet to come. Such silence does not become ancient capitals. If it is the calm before a storm, we can only hope these experienced fishers will weather it.",
  "11221322": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Of all of the baubles that decorate the Apulian coastline, Taranto is the largest, and its reputation precedes it the most. The former Spartan stronghold gives its name to the tarantula, as well as the madness that locals claimed would ensue from its bite. For the unfortunate afflicted, there was only one cure: the tarantella, a frantic dance intended to sweat out the venom. Stories tell of tarantolati in motion for hours or even days, lost in ritual ecstasy to the six-eight time and tambourines.\\r\\n   The real culprit was, in fact, the wolf spider, whose bite is not fatal to humans. Still, we have them to thank for the tarantellas of Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Liszt, and perhaps for our perceptions of Italians as a whole. Across the Continent, we have come to see them as bacchantes, given to fits of tyranny, lovers' quarrels, and duels. Meanwhile, the fishermen of Taranto calmly haul in their catch, unconcerned with anything but the direction of the wind.",
  "11221323": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   In the early days, the Greeks built Taranto's acropolis on a small island where the Mar Piccolo and Mar Grande met. Today, the site - now known as the Città Vecchia - bears the windswept footprints of the millennia. travellers may cross the Ponte di Pietra to the citadel, where the Temple of Poseidon and 18th-century palazzi hide on Byzantine streets. One can easily spend the afternoon wandering the labyrinth, once built to thwart an invading army, now perfect for a promenade.\\r\\n   With the recent change in power and the arrival of war, many other such landmarks around Taranto have been lost. Whether remodelled, demolished, or shelled to oblivion, the Turipenne houses and the old Jewish quarter persist only in the memory. We should count ourselves lucky that some of Taranto's oldest bones have survived the latest Allied victory, and hope that the occupying forces will be kinder to what remains.",
  "11221324": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   On a promontory that juts out into a gulf lies Gaeta, the paradise of the privileged. Walking under the flowering balconies, it is easy to suspect that the residents have never felt an ill wind in their lives. Its climate made it an enclave for the famous faces of Rome, who built their summer villas along its temperate, sparkling shores. A mere hundred and twenty kilometres down the Appian Way, they could eat, drink, revel, and play the great chessboard of history. Today, visitors still come to take the fresh seafood and sun, safe from the intrigues that simmered in the marble halls.\\r\\n   That peace comes with vigilance. The city is ringed with fortified walls, some ancient, some added in the 15th century. Its strategic location positions it as one of the Mediterranean's major ports, and thus one of its most desirable targets in times of war. Gaeta knows that its fortunes could turn at any time. Unlike the inland towns, it does not intend to be caught unaware.",
  "11221325": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   If even the mild tempo of Gaeta proves too vigorous, the Montagna Spaccata provides a contemplative escape. Legend says that the cliff split open at the moment of Christ's death, carving a dizzying grotto deep into the coast. travellers with the fortitude to descend the narrow stairs will find a sleepy sanctuary, a site of pilgrimage for a thousand years. Nearby lies the Grotta del Turco, which bears the fabled handprint of a pirate who was cursed when he professed his lack of faith. The sacred and profane coexist down among the rocks. Nature, in its wisdom, welcomes the penitent and heathen alike.\\r\\n   As light streams down the grotto and scatters on the jagged stones, one forgets the tanks, the bombing, the cares of the world. Visitors are removed entirely from their sense of place and time, humbled in the presence of something greater than themselves. Greater than nations, even: the Allied forces have snatched it from the Axis' jaws, and the waves crash on, unaffected, as they always have.",
  "11221326": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Moving in from the coast, we reach the town that the ancients once called Abellinum. Seated in a valley in Irpinia, the rolling hills are no stranger to the unrest we now find across the Continent. It weathered attacks from the Goths and Vandals in early antiquity, and indeed drew the interest of Sulla, the first Roman dictator. Even nature itself seems hostile. The streets have shifted from earthquakes, and the wine-dark shadow of Vesuvius looms to the west. From time to time, the scourge of Pompeii sends ash clouds on the wind, reminding the region what happens to those who challenge it.\\r\\n   Yet, when the airplanes retreat and the afternoon paints the bell tower with gold, the Avellino skies betray none of its fraught history. In fact, the town likely has the volcanic sediment to thank for its lush, green fields that bulge with hazelnuts and grapes. So it often is in Italy - a tenuous courtship dance between plenty and destruction, between present and past.",
  "11221327": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   The architecture of Avellino reflects its long legacy: a patchwork of country stucco and Neoclassical elegance. The yellow and white houses with their red-tiled roofs stagger across the valley like wildflowers, belying the rubble below. Though some of the edifices have escaped damage, just out of view, the Ponte Ferriera bears the scars of a hasty panzer retreat.\\r\\n   After weeks of sustained combat, operations in the area have ceased. Slowly but surely, life creeps back into the streets again. The shops of the Corso Vittorio Emanuele have opened their doors, and the smells of aubergine and sausage float up to the windows. At the sixth church bell, the nuns emerge from the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie, their black veils fluttering in the breeze. If they step over crumbling stones, they persist regardless. To not rebuild would be to admit that the Axis has been more powerful than all the conquerors that came before.",
  "11221328": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   The serene, unpretentious Foggia rests in the heart of the Tavoliere Plains, the breadbasket of Apulia. The nearby towns of Lucera and Troia flow with olive oil, and the farms of Bovino yield sausages and ham. Yet Foggia has only truly flourished since medieval times, perhaps because farmers have struggled to contend with the land itself. The earth around Foggia is marshy, and yielded poor crops until a Norman explorer suggested draining it. In times of economic decline, it has returned to its boggy state, cautioning those who till its now-abundant ground against hubris.\\r\\n   After a long day's harvest, the Cathedral of the Madonna dei Sette Veli offers an incense-perfumed refuge. Its mullioned windows and Baroque walls guard the Iconavetere, a gilded Byzantine tablet that represents the Virgin Mary. Local folklore says that shepherds found it in the swamp when an ox knelt by the water and flames glowed at the surface. How it came to be there in the first place remains unknown, but to ask would tarnish its mystery. Relics, like ladies, must have their secrets.",
  "11221329": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   For those who tire of visiting churches, it would be a sin not to partake of the bounty that Foggia has on display. The trattorias offer pancotto, a simple dish of vegetables and bread, devised by poor housewives so as not to waste the kitchen scraps. The truly starving may indulge in tiella - a casserole of tomatoes, potatoes, and courgettes - and propato, a yeasty cinnamon-honey pastry, for dessert. And for at least one meal, one must eat pasta. Foggia's golden granaries supply the whole nation with fusilli, troccoli, and orecchiette.\\r\\n   But the flat lands around Foggia now provide a more sinister resource: clear views and long stretches for the construction of airfields. As the Roman legionnaires paved roads and the provincial kings built railways, so Foggia's transport networks connect the fighting forces of our age. For now, it remains under Allied auspices. If history repeats itself, we would do well to note that the army who controls the food supply often wins the war.",
  "11221330": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   In the northeast corner of Molise, the quaint fishing port of Termoli sits upon a winding ribbon of smooth seawall. One glimpse from a boat, and the traveller immediately spies the trabucchi, the wooden icons of the Campobasso shores. The leggy structures jut out from bridges that lash them to the rocks, and their rickety arms skim for fish in even the harshest storms. Some say they learned to build them from the Phoenicians. Though none can prove it, Termoli maintains that some of the old ways are still the best.\\r\\n   Outsiders do not come to Termoli. In the warm months, the resorts fill with Neapolitan beachcombers, but few non-Italians even acknowledge its existence. Perhaps Termoli seems too comfortable with a languorous way of life, with its uncomplicated piazza and unhurried afternoon shade. One wonders whether Termoli simply knows that everything happens in due course. If we have but one summer a year, Termoli reminds us to savour it.",
  "11221331": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   It seems implausible to imagine that a haven like Termoli could ever have weathered a moment's disharmony. Yet its fortifications betray its history as a Lombard holdout, one that eventually fell to Norman conquest. Centuries ago, they likely ensconced the whole town. Today, only the castle remains, perched over the whitecaps like a stout Swabian lighthouse. With its drawbridge and archers' corridor, it serves as one of Termoli's few reminders that no port is too humble to be strategically irrelevant.\\r\\n   Still, Termoli could not have expected to find itself at the centre of an amphibious landing and a bitter defensive line. The roadblocks that Royal Marines deployed to curtail the German onslaught still clutter the streets at the edge of town. The river now sports a bridge, hastily built by engineers, so that British reinforcements could charge across its banks. Surely the towers and walls were borne of the same necessity. With each conflict, Termoli adds another tactical curiosity to its landscape, proving that only fools mistake modesty for weakness.",
  "11221332": "   Today marks eight days in a row with no airgrams to deliver. I was afraid the whole microfilm thing might be a bust. I don't blame the government for trying. Trouble was, the letters had to be so short, most people didn't have room for everything they wanted to say. So they thought, \"Well, Terry and Jake at the Campania field office are young and strong. They can carry those huge mailbags up and down the hills again.\" They're lucky I've got nothing else to do except write in this journal. What is it on those posters? \"Get your teeth into the job.\"\\r\\n   Even on the hardest days, though, the people make it worthwhile.

One day, he's shored up a book about how to build bigger muscles. The next, he's trying to teach himself card tricks. I figure if a writer really wanted to understand humanity, he ought to join the Army. He'd learn more than he bargained for.",
  "11221333": "   Today, I had a bag that took me off my usual route. Come to find out, they were parcels for the veterinary corps. I had no idea we even still had a veterinary corps. I guess I assumed they'd retired it when we stopped using horses. Yet there they were, a whole squad with their pack mules and sighthounds. Lucky. I wish I had a dog to help me make deliveries.\\r\\n   The fellas were in good spirits, so they let me pet one of them. He was a nice boy. Very calm. Looked like the mutt that Della and I had on Grandma's farm. Animals have their own ideas about when they're through with you, though. When I tried it with one of the mules, it kicked me flat on my back. I must've looked furious as I stood up, because their commander said, \"Easy, Foote. The Army had to pay for that mule. You, they got free.\" Had to drive all the way home in my muddy uniform. If that happens again, I'm petitioning the Army for hazard pay.",
  "11221334": "   Big load of local newspapers to deliver this morning. Seems everybody wants to know what's going on at home. We've got editions from all over - Victoria, Ottawa, Calgary, even the St. Croix Courier and the Chilliwack Progress. Nothing from Charlottetown for me, but that's all right. I know it's hard for Della to hold down the fort all by herself.\\r\\n   I hope the fellas on my next trip don't give me any nonsense. I'll never forget trying to deliver to the 1st Armoured Brigade. I arrived in the evening before they'd sat down to dinner, so they were still out in the fresh air, tinkering with the engines. As soon as I stepped onto the field, the one beside me backfired! I've never heard a tailpipe kick so hard in my life. I dropped my bag and had to run after the letters before they blew away. Their CO laughed himself silly and hollered, \"Feisty, isn't she?\" It's all well and good for them. They're used to working with those beasts every day. I'd wager the truck they gave me couldn't outrun a plough horse.",
  "11221335": "   Thankfully, no tanks this time. Just a milk run out to the airfield. The 428th will be grounded there for a while, so they were touching up the girls on the sides of their planes. I asked the flyboys how they were able to paint so well from memory. One told me I was welcome to model for them if I wanted to. He cracked all his friends up, of course. At least I had the presence of mind to retort that it was a tempting offer, but I'd be too busy.\\r\\n   Honestly, I've got to stop setting myself up for these things. On the other hand, it's kind of my job, isn't it? They call us the Morale Squadron for a reason, and I didn't volunteer out of courage or love of country, really. I know a thing or two about loneliness. If I can show the men that somebody's keeping them in their mind, that's enough for me.\\r\\n   (Jake, if you're snooping in here, don't tell the prime minister, all right? Sticking it to the Germans, yes, sir. Communication is the bedrock of victory.)",
  "11221336": "   Finally! An evening off. A bomber flew in this afternoon and collected the whole week's outgoing mail in one trip. The pilot said he and his pals in the 168th will be making transatlantic flights so we can run more smoothly. I admire his pluck, but he'd better get ready. The Christmas rush should start this week. We'll be up to our eyeballs in twine and kraft paper.\\r\\n   Or, I will, anyway. Jake's got a new girlfriend in town, so I've been doing most of the sorting and bagging by myself. She must be the third since he arrived at the office. How does he manage it? We're at war. It's not like there are dances to go to or pictures to see. One of these days, I'll have the gumption to tell him to stop horsing around. Pull his weight. At least introduce me to one of her friends.\\r\\n   I haven't gotten a letter from Della in a while. I hope everything's all right. I wonder if I should write to her and see how she is...",
  "11221337": "   Do you ever have an encounter so strange, you swear you couldn't have it twice? I think I just met someone from an adventure serial. Today, I stopped at a camp that had set up a makeshift target board, and one of the men was throwing knives at it before he fetched his mail. I inquired about where he learned how to do a thing like that. He told me he'd been in a travelling circus before he joined. Third-generation, too! He didn't realise how useful his trade would be. Only then did I see that all the knives on the board were German trophies. Sent a chill up my spine.\\r\\n   When I made it back, I found a letter from Della waiting. Turns out she hadn't written because she'd been so busy outside. Gavin Fraser from down the street has started a victory garden, and the two have been digging at it together for the past two weeks. Is everybody going around with somebody but me? Maybe I should take up knife throwing. No, that wouldn't impress girls. It'd scare them.",
  "11221338": "   The radio reported a storm front coming in from the northwest. Sounds like it'll rain cats and dogs for a couple of days straight. Right when I have a delivery route straight through the mountains, naturally. I must be the unluckiest sap in the entire CPC.\\r\\n   I shouldn't grumble. I'll do my job. It's never as bad as I think. We've got quotas, and I could be out there in a foxhole instead. Besides, it's not the cold that bothers me. After twenty Atlantic winters, I'm made of sterner stuff than anything Italy could throw at me.\\r\\n   Mainly, I hope I don't get stuck like the last time it rained this hard. Halfway through the run, my back tyre rolled right into a ditch. I had to walk to a nearby tomato farm to ask for help. I didn't speak any Italian. They didn't speak English. We figured it out after some charades and arguing, I think. I tried to pay them with some emergency rations I had in the back. Hope they enjoyed their canned beans? More than I would have, for sure.",
  "11221339": "   Phew! Finally back from that mountain run unscathed. I was right. It was an adventure, but not the one I thought it'd be. It was already raining hard when I left, and about twenty klicks in, I found an American postal truck in the same predicament I'd been in. Might even have been the same ditch. I said it was no use trying to unstick that tyre, and he could come with me. We'd take turns delivering. Amazing how sharing a language helps.\\r\\n   The Americans must have seen action recently, because when we pulled up, we found a medic fussing over a few of them with bandages. He looked like we'd come with news of an Allied surrender until he heard that we'd brought a letter for him. That lit him up like Christmas. He told me that he had a nurse, Ava, stationed in Sicily, with real dark brown hair and a mind that could fry an egg. She sounds like a pistol. Sounds like she ought to write more often, too. The only thing better than mail call is a medic with a happy face.",
  "11221340": "   I'm putting this here because I don't think I can say anything out loud. I don't want to get anybody hurt, least of all myself. This morning, the field office received a telegram that said a letter with a very specific address would arrive in the next few days. We're to deliver it as soon as it comes, on our regular route. They were specific about that, too. Jake thinks it's so we won't look like we're going out of our way. There's only one reason why the head office would be so secretive about it, and it's not because we're delivering Buckram's classified cake recipe.\\r\\n   Now, Terry, you're not going to be foolish about this. Follow your orders. Don't start poking around other divisions' business. If the letter is coded intel, that information is above your pay grade. On the other hand, they are trusting you to deliver it. Is this what it's like to be important? I could never go into politics. Or espionage, apparently. I'll be in deep trouble if the enemy ever finds this journal...",
  "11221341": "   I had to hurry in and write this as soon as I heard the news. I might've been part of a secret mission after all. While the I Corps kept the Germans busy north of here, another unit snuck in and captured the villa down the road. Right after we make a delivery that we have to keep close to the vest? It could be a coincidence, I suppose. But what if it's not? I bet the folks back home would see me in a different light if they knew. Well, apart from Della. She's always believed in me.\\r\\n   I'm starting to think I should collect all the stories I've written about the people I've met and the wild things I've seen. Something more official than just these scribbled journal entries. Maybe I should type a manuscript up and send it to a publisher. I wonder whether people would read it. They probably wouldn't believe a few of them, but I know they really happened, and that's what matters to me.\\r\\n   Wait a minute. I don't even know any publishers. How am I going to do this? I'll figure it out when I'm home, I guess!",
  "11221342": "Dearest Dijana,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've made it to Naples with a minimum of fuss. They've given me a lovely room with a view of the seafront. It reminds me of the hotel we stayed in on our honeymoon, with the potted palms in the lobby and the great crystal chandeliers. It seems vulgar to enjoy such luxury these days. I suppose Head Office spares no expense when you intend to perform a service for them in return.\\r\\n   For now, all I need to do is wait and establish my presence here. Have a drink at the hotel bar. Be seen around the pool. I can't say what comes after that. I'm not being coy - I don't know. I'm awaiting further instruction in the next week or two. Apparently, if a certain gentleman approaches me, I'm to befriend him, and express a healthy interest in his business. From there, my future remains even more uncertain. The length of my assignment could depend on the length of the war itself.\\r\\n   The fact of the matter is this: I'm not sure when I'll be able to write to you again.",
  "11221343": "   Once my work begins, I will disappear into my new life completely. I should have no attachments, no preexisting allegiances. I will need to assume that I am always being watched - how I spend my money, who I call, who I send mail to. They will already be skeptical of me because I'm not one of them. I need to prove that I'm ready to commit fully to their cause.\\r\\n   While I'm gone, I want you to keep to our regular routine. Get up at the same time. Have your burek and coffee. Read the newspaper. Practise your cello. Take Branko for a walk around Hyde Park. If the ladies from the orchestra invite you to tea, take them up on it. After a while, you won't even miss me. I've been away so much for work, I know you've had to learn how to live a life of your own.\\r\\n   I wish I didn't need to keep asking you to be strong. I've put you through too much. You've already left one home behind. I wish we lived in better times. I hope by doing what I'm doing, I can help usher them in a little faster.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours in confidence,\\r\\nNikola",
  "11221344": "Dearest Dijana,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've thought about reaching out to you in secret a hundred times. I wanted so badly to reassure you that I was alive. Finally, the Allies have gained control of the region, and Head Office has authorised me to write to you again.\\r\\n   Maybe you've read in the papers that Rinaldo Perotti, the famous automobile baron, has vanished in Northern Italy. Around the time we came to London, Head Office took interest in him. They believed that he was smuggling munitions for the SS. However, they did not have enough proof to substantiate it. That was where I came in, and why I had to disappear.\\r\\n   The plan was simple. I was to become Zoran Čilić, a shipping magnate whose fortunes had been thwarted by Allied blockades. I resented the government-in-exile for fleeing Belgrade, and I believed Europe should be ruled by the strong, which drew me to him. Once we'd met, I needed to insert myself into his inner circle. Eventually, I was to suggest a financial partnership. The trouble is, the more you trust someone, the better you know them. Every step I took was a step closer to being found out.",
  "11221345": "   I had a few prepared answers in case anyone asked questions, but I believe it was your knowledge of music that saved my life. Last month, Perotti invited me to a performance of Verdi's Requiem. A man from Head Office waited in the next box to collect my report. But you know the Requiem has no intermission, so I could not slip away, and I resorted to tapping the message in Morse code on my knee. When Perotti noticed, he grew suspicious. I quickly told him that one of the percussionists was off-beat. I steered the conversation toward tempo in opera, and mercifully, he lost interest. I'll always remember how you helped. May you always hold it over me.\\r\\n   After that, it was over. British soldiers apprehended us en route to Trieste. It had to look real, you understand. I'm leaving on the first ship tomorrow morning. Zoran Čilić is as good as dead. Some days, I look in the mirror and fear I've forgotten how to live as myself again. Then it all comes back. I'll wake up, and Branko will bark at the postman, and you'll make burek and coffee. Times will be better.\\r\\n\\r\\nYours again soon,\\r\\nNikola",

  "11221716": "The fighting at the Salerno beachhead is taking its toll, sir. Our men will not be able to hold out much longer.",
  "11221717": "Sir, we've been able to connect with the 8th Army. Our troops at Salerno are having difficulty getting off the beaches. We're now in a position to help.",

  "11221725": "The Krauts have nearly finished their defenses along the Voturno Line. If we leave them alone for much longer we're gonna have a hell of a time breaking through.",

I've been very busy with what we call \"listening patrol,\" so getting a letter from you has been the best part of my week.\\r\\n   How are you and your mum holding up? She says that the two of you were able to get your hands on some chocolate recently. Don't know how she managed it, rationing being what it is. I say the two of you ought to enjoy it as soon as you read this. I know it's tempting to save it \"for good,\" but when you finally get round to eating it, it'll be all chalky and stale. Trust me - it is here. Still never turn it down, though!\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",
  "11221898": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   You have no idea how much it means that Nancy wants to write to me as well. Feel a bit spoiled that I have two letters to look forward to. The listening patrol does keep me up at funny hours, but I don't mind. The air's nice. Reminds me of summer back home.\\r\\n   We had a slow week until yesterday, when the Red Cross parcels turned up. You'll never believe what they had for us. Tea! Actual English tea. I never felt strongly one way or the other about the stuff before. After months of bully beef and oatmeal, it's all I can think about. I didn't realise how much I took your cooking for granted until I didn't have it. One more thing to look forward to, eh?\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221899": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Nancy wrote to me about the business with Frieda McClintock. She's growing up to be such an upright girl. Who knows? Maybe when she grows up, she'll get into politics and school the men who got us into this war. We'll have to go to all her speeches.\\r\\n   Life continues as normal. This morning, the nurses showed up in full force to make sure the unit's inoculations were in order. We queued up for so long, the man in front of me got sunburned. I know the fellows will have a time with that one. His ears look like bacon strips. It's for a good cause, though. It'd be a shame to be laid up sick in a place as pretty as this.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221900": "Nancy dear,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Congratulations on acing your vocabulary test. Less glad to hear the boys in your class are giving Frieda McClintock a hard time about her name. Frieda's parents and I go way back, and I happen to know that her mother picked that name before they were even married. We didn't care that it was German then.\\r\\n   I want to tell you how proud I am that you didn't join in. It's important for us to always take people as they are. This war is complicated business, but if everyone your age learns a little charity, then we'll never have another one. In the meantime, it's up to men like me to charge over hills and make sure you've got a safe world to grow up in.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",
  "11221901": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Give Nancy a hug from me about her Brownie news. We've been doing a fair bit of camping ourselves lately. We bunked down in a village on Tuesday, so we can finally do our washing up, and there's always the fellow who has to hit you with a towel or hide your socks. They're good lads, really. It's just like living with a rugby team all the time.\\r\\n   This morning, one of our sergeants had an ingenious idea. He realised that we could heat water in our helmets over a fire. That meant a hot shave! First one in months. I feel as dapper as the day we got married. I'll never curse the boiler in our flat for running too hot again.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221902": "Nancy dear,\\r\\n\\r\\n   You joined Girl Guides? That's fantastic! Have you got your Brownie uniform yet?  Let your mum know if it doesn't fit. She can alter it for you. She's clever with that sort of thing. She'd be a lifesaver over here - my friends and I joke that the Army makes uniforms in two sizes, \"too large\" and \"too small.\" The first pair of trousers they gave me were over an inch too short, and it looked exactly as silly as you'd expect.\\r\\n   You, however, are going to look very smart. I want you to write and tell me which proficiency badge you earn first. You're in good company, you know. Princess Margaret was a Brownie, too. Now, if that doesn't make you feel important, nothing will.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",
  "11221903": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Thank you for the photo of Nancy in her new coat. You're a hero for stretching those clothing coupons until her birthday. Shame you couldn't find a pair of shoes, too. I know you'll keep trying. They have to spare some leather sometime.\\r\\n   Speaking of clothes, you'll like this: we met a curious man in a Yugoslavian jacket at our last rendezvous. After a minute, I recognised it was Barry! You know, that Barry, our old neighbour in Bethnal Green. Turns out the Germans captured him in Egypt. Our lads sprung him last month. He said he'd traded bread for the jacket, and it was the warmest he'd ever had. It'll have a fine story behind it when he brings it home. I wish him well.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221904": "Nancy dear,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Happy birthday. I know I'm a few days late, and I know the best present would've been coming home to spend it with you. The other dads and I are still hard at work over here, and sadly, I've got no idea when we'll sort it out. You're as bright as a button for your age. You'll understand. Let's all hope that I'll be back to see you turn eight next year.\\r\\n   Meanwhile, I'm glad that you and Frieda McClintock went to see the Lassie film. I'm sure she appreciated that you invited her. Birthdays are better with a friend. I want to see it myself when I'm home, so don't tell me any details except whether the dog survives. That'll tide me over until then.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",
  "11221905": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Merry Christmas, sweetheart. I imagine it was a quiet one. Not so here! We listened to the King's speech and spent the whole day tucking in. In the evening, we built a crackling fire and sang carols, which sounded as good as you'd expect for a bunch of lads with no training.\\r\\n   I hope Nancy enjoys her hair ribbons. I was never great about going to church, but I find myself thinking about the \"peace and goodwill\" part this year. If we can keep banding together and helping each other the way we have, I think we're going to win this, even if it takes a while. Christmastime makes me soppy about that sort of thing, I guess. Don't tell anyone! They'll think I've gone soft.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221906": "Nancy dear,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Merry Christmas! What a relief to hear the tree made it all right. I jumped at it when I heard the YMCA would let me order one. You and your mum can decorate it with the paper chains you made in class, and you'll be the envy of everybody on our street.\\r\\n   I find that Christmastime makes us appreciate the little things. Whether it's a smile, or a song we enjoy, or - oh, who am I kidding? I know what Christmas is really about. Presents! I was the same at your age. Now that you've read this letter, you are hereby authorised to open your package and see what Father Christmas sent you. (With advice from me, of course.)\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",
  "11221907": "Dearest Elaine,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I've been given the rarest of Army delights: a day off. We reached our objective early, so our commander put us at ease until further notice. Our sergeant found a leather ball in a nearby farmhouse, and we kicked it round a field for hours. I haven't done that since I was Nancy's age.\\r\\n   The lads and I have our disagreements, I suppose. But if you spend enough time with someone, you'll find something in common with them. One of them, Herbert, grew up in Poplar. Another, Fred, has a daughter, too. I wouldn't rather anyone else have my back, except maybe you. You'd give Jerry such a scolding, he'd surrender just to salvage his dignity, and I'd be the proudest husband in all of Europe.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll my love,\\r\\nJoe",
  "11221908": "Nancy dear,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Your mum tells me that you and Frieda McClintock have been going round collecting metal and glass from the neighbourhood. You're being a huge help! Everything you salvage will go to the war effort, which means more fuel and supplies that might get me home sooner.\\r\\n   It sounds like you're working very hard, and I commend you for it. Still, don't forget you're young, and you can let yourself have fun. It's bad enough to deal with the rationing. Besides, when you're grown, you'll look back on these days and wonder at all the free time you had. I know - it's hard to believe that you'll be my age one day. Does that seem really old? You'll see it isn't when you're here.\\r\\n\\r\\nLove,\\r\\nDad",

The heat in Jerusalem and Cairo was barely tolerable, and so dry that you could feel the wind chapping your face. I imagined our friend Wojtek would take it terribly, but he's never complained. Maybe he's being stoic. He seems like the strong, silent type.\\r\\n   That must sound strange. I suppose it's even colder where you are. I remember Warsaw in February. I imagine Byelorussia is the same. They're not working you too hard, are they? Are they giving you enough to eat? Mama said I'm supposed to look out for you. If I have to take it up with the Red Army, I will.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222252": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm so relieved you're all right. We hear so many stories about the Soviets, it's hard to know the truth. There's a joke that makes the rounds here sometimes about an American, a British, and a Russian soldier who get stuck in the same foxhole. They debate how long their rations will last, and when the American brags that he gets two thousand kilocalories a day, the Russian scoffs, \"No one can eat that much cabbage.\"\\r\\n   The overprotective part of me wishes you weren't fighting, too. I was supposed to keep you away from that kind of thing. On the other hand, it might be one of the best places you could be, considering. Just keep yourself alive, or Mama will kill me, understand?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222253": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Things continue as normal here. Not much to report. Wojtek has been drinking us out of coffee. He likes having it in the mornings with us, and he's a big fellow, so we're trying to ration it until more arrives. Or, rather, he's \"Private Wojtek\" now. He couldn't come on the transport ship unless he was a soldier, so we officially drafted him. Now he can follow us anywhere.\\r\\n   I hate to ask an indelicate question, but something is bothering me. Have you heard from Mama? I haven't in a long time. It's not like her. She sent letters every week when I was in Egypt. Could you write to some of our friends and see whether they've spoken to her? I'll send one, too. They can't lose both our letters.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222254": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   So neither Old Man Filip nor Mrs. Kowalczyk know anything. That's strange. She must not be living in our old house anymore. Although, if she left, wouldn't they have seen someone moving the furniture? Something doesn't add up. I'll write to Aunt Dorota. If Mama told anyone anything, it'd be her.\\r\\n   I appreciate you trying regardless. A lot of the other men are having trouble reaching their relatives, so don't be down on yourself. I can't lie, I wish you were on this side. It'd make a great many things easier. But it can't be helped, so don't beat yourself up about that, either. Taking that job in Białystok seemed like a good opportunity. We couldn't have known where the Soviets would draw the lines then.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222255": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Took over a town from a British unit today. They're moving on, so we have to make sure the Germans don't recapture this post. They were hopeless with Polish, but a lot of us speak a bit of English, so we had something resembling an exchange eventually. Mainly, they wanted to know about Wojtek. At least he behaved himself this time. I'll never forget the day he stole a clothesline full of ladies' underwear.\\r\\n   Still waiting to hear from Aunt Dorota. I wish she'd hurry up and write soon. It sounds like things in Warsaw are about to take a turn. Some of the men have friends in the Home Army, and they won't say anything specific. But I'll be listening to the news, I'll say that much.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222256": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   No news about Warsaw. We saw some shooting earlier, and when it was over, we captured one of the German men. He protested in Polish that he was Henryk Bakula, from Katowice, and the Germans had drafted him. We gave him some of our remaining coffee and found him a uniform. It brightened his spirits considerably. Amazing what being on the right side will do.\\r\\n   Speaking of, I've been thinking. When this war is over, what will we do? Will I have to stay in the West, and you in the Soviet zone? Where will Mama go when we find her? I suppose that's for the politicians to decide. We won't get a say in it. Plan for the worst, hope for the best. That's what she always told us.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222257": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Things are deceptively quiet these days. It reminds me of Egypt, when we'd go weeks with only the desert to keep us company. The British keep trying to capture that big abbey in the north, but they're not having much luck with it. If it doesn't fall soon, they'll probably send us in. None of our higher-ups have told us anything definite yet. It's just a feeling. It wouldn't be the first time the II Corps saved the day.\\r\\n   This morning, I got a letter from Aunt Dorota's neighbor. He said that she and Uncle Miloš left over two months ago. Where has everyone gone? I'm running out of ideas for who to contact next. If there's anyone else you can think of, don't hold out on me.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222258": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I nearly leaped out of my chair when I read your letter. So Mama made it to England with Aunt Dorota and Uncle Miloš.

I feared they might be in one of those refugee camps in Tehran, but they're not. They're safe. I can finally sleep easy tonight.\\r\\n   Is there anyone we can write to who might have their address? An embassy, or something? I'll ask my commander. He might know. In the meantime, I'm going to go right now and tell the entire unit. We'll have beers all around, even one for Wojtek. He deserves it.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222259": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   By now you've probably heard what happened at Monte Cassino. The defensive line wouldn't budge, and the Allies decided enough was enough. We were about to storm the abbey when the commanders ordered a bombing to finish things once and for all. It was a shame to raise our flag over ruins. It wasn't my abbey, particularly, but it meant something to the people there. Didn't Warsaw mean something to us?\\r\\n   I suppose I understand their decision. It probably saved many lives. As it is, we're a little worse for wear, but fit enough to march on. After a battle like that, I don't worry about what we may encounter next. Besides, I've got Wojtek to protect me. What German unit can say that?\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222260": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   I'm sure the news has made it to the Eastern Front by now. The abbey is ours. The Allies sent us in after all. I gather there was some talk of bombing it until the eleventh hour, when the commanders decided to handle things the old-fashioned way. It was a long fight, and a good deal of the others were wounded. Charges are like that. But they're on the mend, and we can rest easy knowing that we did the right thing.\\r\\n   I hope you weren't worried about me. I knew whatever happened, we were trained to handle it. For once, we were well-fed and well-rested, and we had Wojtek on our side. We even taught him to salute. Honestly, the Germans never stood a chance against us.\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222261": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Now that we've taken the abbey, we still have clean-up work to do. Our commander sent us out to keep pushing the defensive line. I don't mind. Let me at them, as far as I'm concerned. If we can survive that charge, we can survive anything.\\r\\n   We were so busy afterward, I forgot to tell you what Wojtek did. He saw us lifting ammunition crates and helped us carry the shells cross the field. Our commander was impressed enough to promote him. I have to say, I never imagined I'd serve with the first bear corporal.\\r\\n   I did mention Wojtek was a bear, right? Our lieutenant bought him in a train station in Iran. I suppose that would put a new spin on those stories. Write and tell Mama that!\\r\\n\\r\\nEmil",
  "11222262": "Janusz,\\r\\n\\r\\n   Now that we've taken the abbey, we still have clean-up work to do. Our commander sent us out to keep pushing that defensive line. I don't mind. As far as I'm concerned, if we're going to bomb them, let's drive them all the way back to Berlin.\\r\\n   We were so scattered afterward, I never told you about Wojtek's moment of glory. When he saw us struggling with the ammunition crates, he ran over, and we loaded them in his great, hairy arms. Then he rushed them to the artillery guns. I'm starting to think every unit should have a bear on their side.\\r\\n   I did mention Wojtek is a bear at some point, didn't I? I'll have to tell you the whole story. Not now, though.

The viticulturists of its neighbour, Salice Salentino, have just this year perfected a new method of producing rosé. Though English connoisseurs may be less familiar with the light, fruity strain, historical evidence suggests its preparation is far from new. Indeed, it is likely the oldest type of wine. It requires little time to prepare, and the Greco-Roman palate considered darker wines too harsh.\\r\\n   However, with their proximity to the Mediterranean, it was inevitable that these towns would attract strategic interest. Army engineers have descended upon the peninsular enclaves, and an American airfield now looms downwind from the vineyards. The move has paid off: their heavy bombers now rule the skies, asserting Allied dominion over the area. One wonders how these modern fortresses will sit aside the ruins of Roman barracks, interrupting the landscape long after they have served their purpose.",
  "11222268": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   In the verdant, sloping sprawl of the Abruzzo heartland lies Castel di Sangro, whose size belies its strength. The nature-minded traveller will find themselves immediately at home, and the city-bound should not let their itineraries discourage them. Here, the air fortifies the lungs, and the mighty Sangro River courses through a white-capped valley and lends the town its name. Such natural peace must have appealed to the third and last line of Caesar, who lived out their days here, far from the bustle of Rome.\\r\\n   Beyond the bucolic backdrop and the vestiges of history, linguists will find Castel di Sangro of particular interest. The residents speak a dialect that is often, but not always, mutually intelligible to the Italian spoken elsewhere. Luckily, the locals are patient and eager to understand. If all else fails, the visitor may fall back on gestures to see them through. After a few exchanges, one develops a newfound respect for the Mediterranean propensity to converse with one's hands.",

Historians estimate the town has been rebuilt no less than five times. That it still stands is a paean to the residents' tenacity. Each time, some remnant of the previous construction remains, weaving a tapestry of eras into the walls and rooftops.\\r\\n   So it shall be a sixth time, as the hum of mountain life is deafened by the the all-too-familiar whistle of artillery. The river hooks through the centre of the dreaded Gustav Line, and to take Castel di Sangro is to gain a vital foothold. For a time, the Poles held it proudly, though this only emboldened the German forces to parachute in and attempt to take it back.

  "11222270": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Of all the ways Italian builders have contended with their mountainous landscape, Calitri is home to one of the most whimsical. Regarding the Campanian town from afar, it appears almost absurd, with houses stacked like a child's idea of a ziggurat. A stroll through the Antico Borgo reveals the truth: a maze of houses and streets built into the rugged slope. Arches and staircases connect one alley to the next, creating intimate paths that resist the vulgarity of automobiles.\\r\\n   At Calitri's altitude - 530 metres above sea level - a gentle breeze tempers even the most ardent summer sun. Off-season visitors will find it loses none of its charm in winter, when snow dusts the rooftops and creates a beguiling layer cake. If Calitri has one failing, it is through no fault of its own: at over 120 kilometres inland from Naples, travellers will be less likely to encounter it. One must be mindful not to lavish all of their attention on the diamonds of the coastal cities. Calitri is a cabochon in its own right.",
  "11222271": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Beyond its labyrinthine conquest of the mountainside, Calitri may boast another architectural feat. Archaeologists speculate that the remains of a Roman neviera could rest beneath the Gagliano cemetery. These ancient structures consisted of domes and underground chambers, and were used for preserving food before the advent of the icebox. Excavations require effort and funds at the best of times. Naturally, our current strife has stalled such enterprises even further. Regardless, it gives cause to meditate on history's greatest curiosity: societies that came before us were not always primitive.\\r\\n   Yet if the name of Calitri sticks in the memory, it is due to a more recent mark on history. Two years ago, British fliers destroyed a nearby aqueduct in an attempt to destabilise the country's water supply. The ill-fated Operation Colossus did not go to plan, but Allied fortunes in the area have improved since then. If we are to learn anything from Calitri's slopes, it is that sometimes, compromise paves the path to victory.",
  "11222272": "In the Footsteps of Caesar\\r\\nEdward Sinclair\\r\\n\\r\\n   Benevento has always had a curious relationship with the winds that drift over its whispering trees and careworn walls. The city, situated at the confluence of the Sabato and Calore Irpino, was originally called Maleventum in ancient times. In the third century B.C., the Romans decided the name was an ill omen, so they changed it to the more auspicious Beneventum instead. With their superstitions quelled, the colony began to flourish, and it eventually stretched from Avellino to the river Tammaro.\\r\\n   Despite its prosperity, Benevento has attracted less attention from outsiders than other Roman settlements. The majority of tourists remain in nearby Naples or Rome, leaving the less-conventional traveller to explore Benevento's delights in peace. They will find themselves well-rewarded: the Ponte Leproso sparkles in the afternoons, and the markets sell their local speciality, the potent Strega liqueur.

Such grandeur may seem excessive for a city of Benevento's calibre until one considers its position on the Appian Way. Benevento does not merely sit by two rivers. It also crosses six roads, and has played host to peasants and potentates in turn.\\r\\n   Yet Rome propelled itself to glory on the back of conquest, and so Benevento has also borne witness to armies and generals. As the shadows of heavy bombers cut through the clouds and explosions shake dust from the ceiling, we realise little has changed.

  "11223506": "The Yanks have lost too many men and they're pulling out. Looks like we're on our own, lads.",
  "11223507": "Alright, I've got good news. Those Yanks we helped out are eager to take a crack at the Germans. They're also willing to lend us their base if we need to fall back and reinforce.",

  "11223515": "Our forces are close enough to the Railway Gun to be able to capture it. Eliminate the enemy troops guarding it it and secure that gun!",

  "11223521": "That sodding railway gun's targeting our headquarters. Let's get over there and disable that gun before they destroy our HQ and we lose Anzio.",
  "11223522": "Spotter Eliminated! Artillery will no longer target this area and time between artillery shots has increased!",

  "11223608": "That's Catanzaro captured. The enemy is on the run, but there's no way we can catch up to the entire German army like this. Hold tight at Catanzaro so our reserves can catch up. We're planning further landing operations up north at Salerno and Taranto to cut off the retreating Axis forces.",
  "11223609": "Bloody hell! Ortona's a soddin' shit show.",
  "11223610": "All right, I know this looks bad, but we need this city. Explosives or heavy tanks will get us through the barricades. And the buildings. Just be sure to clear out any of Jerry's forces you bump into along the way.",

  "11223703": "Those Partisans are taking a right beating! There'll be none of 'em left if we don't hurry up.",
  "11223705": "If we can defeat key units we can force a retreat!",
  "11223706": "I've got good news and bad news. The town's clear but there are more enemy  troops heading this way. No time for a breather, let's get prepped to hold 'em off.",
  "11223707": "The Partisans have set up their defenses in the plaza. They've got medical supplies and they're keen to help. Can't hurt to let them, can it?",
  "11223709": "The Partisan safehouse is coming under heavy fire. We need to protect it.",
  "11223710": "The safehouse is in bad shape. We need to get Jerry's attention.",
  "11223712": "Excellent work. This will give us a foothold and make our advance easier.",
  "11223713": "Excellent work. This will give us a foothold and make our advance easier.",
  "11223716": "Enemy artillery spotted across the river. The Canonne is our best defense!",
  "11223717": "Use Cannonne artillery",
  "11223718": "Right. The emplacement's there, bridge is that way. Let's go fix some shit.",
  "11223719": "All right, that's one lot of repairs done. Keep going.",
  "11223720": "Enemy planes! Scatter!",
  "11223721": "Nice one, lads. The supply route's back up and running. Now Norton can get his Scotch.",
  "11223722": "There's another bunker up ahead. Let's clear Jerry out and get it repaired.",
  "11223723": "Good job, lads. That mortar's gonna come in handy.",
  "11223724": "What did I just say? We need to protect our engineers. Deploy some more and get those repairs done.",
  "11223725": "Engineers are good blokes but they're a bit soft. Like kittens. We'll need to protect them while they work on those repairs.",
  "11223913": "I could have done with \"a hand\" some time ago, Lieutenant. Now what do you plan to do about the Germans?",
  "11223914": "Corporal! You need to do something about those Germans!",
  "11223915": "I'm getting hit! Do something!",
  "11223921": "Left-click the Grenade ability button, then left-click a target position.",
  "11223922": "Left-click the Smoke Barrage ability, then left-click a target position to block an enemy's line of sight.",
  "11223923": "Select the towing half-track and use its Unload command to set up the Flak 36.",
  "11223924": "Left-click the Panzergrenadier Squad to SELECT it.",
  "11223925": "Left-click the Panzer III tank to SELECT it.",
  "11223926": "Right, lads. Don't forget, the guns are our target. Don't go getting yourself killed before we blow 'em up. Or afterwards.",
  "11223927": "That's it, lads, nicely done. That's the first gun out of the way. Only two more to go.",
  "11223928": "There she goes. We're down to the final stretch, lads.",
  "11223929": "There you go, lads. Good work. Jerry's given up and the Navy gets a breather. Everyone's happy.",
  "11223930": "Jerry patrol incoming, lads. Get ready.",
  "11223931": "Keep ya wits about ya, lads. Jerry's got emplacements covering the road. If we can clear them out we can make a beeline to the coastal guns.",
  "11223932": "Alright, lads. We've dealt with the bunkers. All that's left is those coastal guns. Easy.",
  "11223997": "Attacking emplacements resolves on the campaign map.",
  "11223998": "Geisler successfully intercepted. Once you have destroyed his armored vanguard, take out Geisler himself.",
  "11224000": "One more to go.",
  "11224001": "All targets eliminated.",
  "11224002": "Geisler's en route. Let's maintain our advantage. Destroy the remaining tanks before he arrives.",
  "11224003": "Geisler is almost here.",
  "11224004": "Geisler's heading towards the town. Let's give that bastard a warm Allied welcome.",
  "11224005": "Geisler's tank looks like it's ready to meet its maker. Keep at it.",
  "11224006": "Great work. Geisler's men are retreating.",
  "11224007": "Reports show Geisler is en route and will be there shortly. Get ready.",
  "11224008": "This may be our only chance to catch Geisler out in the open like this. We can't let him escape!",
  "11224009": "Geisler escaped! Damn it. Secure the area and regroup. We missed a major opportunity here.",
  "11224012": "This is it, Conti. We're finally going to kick Jerry out of Italy. I hope you've got that chocolate ready for me.",
  "11224013": "I know exactly how many chickens I've got. All of them. See you in Rome.",
  "11224014": "That's one AA gun down. Just one more to go, lads.",
  "11224015": "That's the anti-air done and dusted. I'm sure the RAF will appreciate it. Maybe they'll give us some extra support as a thank you.",
  "11224016": "Our lads are attacking Jerry's right flank, and it's taken 'em by surprise. Should give us a window to take out that artillery battery.",
  "11224017": "That artillery's gonna be a problem, lads. We need to take it out.",
  "11224018": "Woah! That artillery went up like a bonfire on Guy Fawkes night, didn't it?",
  "11224019": "The artillery battery's been destroyed. Good work, lads. That'll make things easier, that's for sure.",
  "11224020": "Okay, lads. I'm getting tired of this war, and I bet Conti I'd be the first to Rome. Time to kick Jerry out of Italy once and for all. Move forward and take out those 88s.",
  "11224021": "That's one 88 down.",
  "11224022": "Yes! That's what I like to see, lads. No more 88s.",
  "11224023": "Alright, lads. You heard him. Get ready for 'em.",
  "11224024": "They're almost here, lads! Hold the line!",
  "11224025": "Nice one, lads. Jerry's scarpered.",
  "11224026": "There we go, lads. We've breached the Winter Line. Next stop, Rome!",
  "11224027": "We've got bombers heading your way, Lieutenant. My troops'll join you at the crossroads. The rest is up to you. Let's see some of the British grit Clarence keeps telling me about.",
  "11224028": "Good morning, Lieutenant. I heard you could do with a hand.",
  "11224029": "We've been able to secure more supplies for you, Lieutenant. Do try to put them to good use.",
  "11224030": "Come on, lads. Let's show Jerry what we're made of!",
  "11224031": "We've got the forward barracks. Good work, lads.",
  "11224032": "Thanks for the help. Let us know if you need anything fixed. Got me toolkit right 'ere.",
  "11224033": "Heads up, lads. Jerry's not giving up just yet.",
  "11224034": "Okay, lads, our flanks are secure. I'm getting tired of this war, and I bet Conti I'd get to Rome first. Time to send Jerry packing.",
  "11224035": "Move forward and capture those strongpoints. Just watch out for the 88s.",
  "11224036": "Right, that's the strongpoints dealt with.",
  "11224037": "Boy, are we glad to see you, Lieutenant. Now, which direction should we be shooting?",
  "11224039": "We finally got Baumann! The world's a better place than it was yesterday. Now let's deal with the rest of these Krauts.",
  "11224040": "God damn, son of a bitch! That bastard Baumann's here! I thought we'd killed him! Lieutenant? You wipe that bastard off the face of the earth, you hear me?",
  "11224041": "Passing the turn refreshes action points as well as movement points.",
  "11224042": "Not enough Action Points",
  "11224043": "Ending the turn will restore your companies' movement and action points.",
  "11224046": "Okay, lads, push forward and take that town hall.",
  "11224047": "Well done, lads. That's a good start.",
  "11224048": "All that bombing and it still wasn't enough to clear Jerry out completely. Time for us to get up close and personal and finish the job.",
  "11224049": "Right, lads. Let's go take this hill.",
  "11224051": "That's all the spotters dealt with, lads. Good work.",
  "11224052": "Monte Cassino is finally ours, lads. Good work.",
  "11224053": "Jerry's occupying Hotel Continental. Expect heavy resistance. And tanks. There are always tanks.",
  "11224054": "Alright, lads. We've captured Hotel Continental. Sounds very swanky.",
  "11224055": "Things ain't gonna get any easier from this point on. It'd be a good idea to set up vehicle production here before we make the final push.",
  "11224056": "Jerry's firing at us from that hill! We need to get up there and capture it.",
  "11224057": "Good work. We've captured Hangman's Hill. Nothing ominous about that name.",
  "11224058": "We've got Partisans up ahead. Let's go give 'em a hand.",
  "11224059": "You're welcome. Glad we could help.",
  "11224060": "Argh! The Partisans have been killed.",
  "11224061": "Jerry's dug in deeper than the Queen's pockets, lads. Not gonna stop us though, is it? No. It isn't.",
  "11224062": "You think it's been bad so far, Nige? Jerry's got reinforcements on the way. Best get prepped, lads.",
  "11224063": "That's gonna rattle the Germans' spirits, eh lads?",
  "11224064": "Can't see anyone surviving that, eh, lads?",
  "11224065": "Artillery incoming!",
  "11224066": "Argh! There's too many of 'em. Fall back. Fall back!",
  "11224067": "Intel reckons there may be Partisan forces pinned down in the town somewhere. Keep your eyes peeled for 'em.",
  "11224068": "Heads up, lads. We've got enemy spotters heading for the abbey.",
  "11224069": "Look out, lads! Booby trap!",
  "11224070": "Booby trap!",
  "11224071": "Jerry's spotted us!",
  "11224072": "HMG! Stay low, lads!",
  "11224074": "Polish troops have cut off Jerry's retreat. Good work, lads. Monte Cassino is ours.",
  "11224075": "Careful, lads. Jerry's got enemy spotters up near the abbey.",
  "11224076": "Haha! The Polish have just hit Jerry from behind. Bet he wasn't expecting that.",
  "11224077": "Right lads, Polish troops have started flanking Jerry. We'll cover them as we advance up the hill and meet them at the top.",
  "11224078": "Those Polish troops are almost at the top of the hill, lads. Come on, we don't want to get left behind.",
  "11224079": "Heads up. Jerry's got spotters in those bunkers. Take 'em out.",
  "11224080": "Looks like the Krauts are pulling back from the town hall.",
  "11224081": "Nice one. Jerry's retreating from the town hall.",
  "11224082": "Haha! Our Polish mates have just given Jerry a nasty surprise. That's what I like to see!",
  "11224083": "Haha! The Polish have just hit Jerry from behind! Bet he wasn't expecting that, eh lads?",
  "11224084": "Good job, lads. We can advance from here.",
  "11224175": "Jerry's planes are gonna keep hitting us with strafing runs unless we can find a way to deal with them. Maybe there's some enemy armour we can nab to help.",
  "11224176": "Good job, lads. Jerry'll think twice about attacking now we have one of their Wirbelwinds. Stupid name though, ain't it?",
  "11224177": "Incoming airstrike!",
  "11224178": "This airfield's the bane of our existence, lads. So, we're gonna capture it and get Jerry's planes off our backs.",
  "11224179": "Our forward scouts are trapped which means we get to be the heroes. Take out Jerry and then we can bask in the glory.",
  "11224180": "Area's clear! Good work, lads.",
  "11224181": "All right, lads. Time to push Jerry out of this airfield. Next stop, the control tower.",
  "11224182": "That's it, lads. Looked a bit dicey there for a bit, but Foggia's ours. Well done.",
  "11224183": "Right, it's been confirmed. Jerry's storing a bucketload of sensitive information on this base, and Norton wants to get his hands on it. Find those documents before they're destroyed.",
  "11224184": "We've got those Jerry documents and it seems the intel we got was right for a change. That'll please Norton.",
  "11224185": "Argh, Jerry's burned those documents we were after. Never mind. Stay focused, we've got an airfield to take.",
  "11224186": "Come on, lads. Jerry's holed up in that building. Get in there and breach it!",
  "11224187": "Flank those MGs to avoid being ground to a pulp.",
  "11224188": "There are enemy vehicles patrolling the area. Get your hands on some enemy bazookas or anti-tank guns and take them out!",
  "11224189": "Airstrike incoming! Take cover.",
  "11224190": "Heads up! Enemy airstrike!",
  "11224191": "Enemy fire from above! Watch out!",
  "11224192": "Airstrike incoming!",
  "11224193": "Airstrike incoming2!",
  "11224194": "Argh, we could have used that flak tank. All right, keep goin'.",
  "11224195": "Good work. Now we've cleared out the control tower, Jerry's planes'll have to back off.",
  "11224196": "Jerry's got heavy armour on the way. Dig in and hold that control tower.",
  "11224197": "Grab any dropped weapons you see. They'll give us some extra firepower to deal with Jerry's patrols.",
  "11224198": "Click to see more about this Battlegroup",
  "11224199": "Locked",
  "11224207": "Save",
  "11224208": "Load",
  "11224211": "That's the first tank dealt with. It's a good start, but we need to keep going.",
  "11224212": "That's one down. Keep it up.",
  "11224213": "Incoming! Get to cover!",
  "11224214": "Argh! Jerry's got the fuel depot. Come on, we've gotta make sure we hold that tower.",
  "11224215": "We've lost the supply dump, but don't give up yet, lads. It's not over till the fat German sings.",
  "11224216": "The Germans have taken the supply dump, lads. Not ideal, but we've still got the tower. Let's keep it that way.",
  "11224217": "Jerry's brought in armour to back up the infantry. If we can take it out, maybe they'll have second thoughts and retreat.",
  "11224218": "Yes! Nice one, lads. Jerry's running off with his tail between his legs. Good job.",
  "11224219": "Ah, bollocks. That's it then. Pull back and we'll see if anyone's got any idea what to do next. Maybe Valenti will have some suggestions.",
  "11224220": "Jerry's got more troops on the way. Quick breather, then it's back at it.",
  "11224221": "This is it, lads. Enemy infantry's on the way. Let's keep 'em away from that tower.",
  "11224222": "Jerry's infantry'll be arriving first, but there'll be armour close behind.",
  "11224225": "Roads allow companies to travel farther in one turn, but are often defended by enemy detachments.",
  "11224226": "Okay, lads, keep at 'em! They're retreating.",
  "11224227": "Mines!",
  "11224228": "Right, lads. Now we've got the bridge we can start bringing the rest of our equipment across.",
  "11224229": "Argh! There's too many of 'em. Fall back, lads!",
  "11224230": "Alright, lads. Jerry's got a lot of guns between us and those objectives. Best we take some time to build up our forces before we move into the city.",
  "11224231": "We're almost there, lads. Keep the pressure on.",
  "11224232": "Good job, lads. Potenza is all ours.",
  "11224233": "Things are a little bit hectic at the moment, but we'll see what we can do.",
  "11224234": "That's one sniper dealt with. Keep your eyes peeled for more.",
  "11224235": "Nice one, lads. Only one more sniper to go.",
  "11224236": "We got those snipers for you, Giorgio. Maybe you can pay us back one day.",
  "11224237": "Sorry, Lorenzo. We did what we could, but it looks like some of those snipers slipped past us.",
  "11224238": "Jerry's been blowing up bridges left, right and center. We need to capture that next bridge before they destroy it.",
  "11224239": "The bridge is secure.",
  "11224240": "Good Job taking that bridge already. It'll be important for our supply chain after the battle!",
  "11224241": "They've got an HMG covering the bridge! Keep your heads down!",
  "11224242": "Mortar! Keep moving and take it out!",
  "11224243": "Watch out, lads. Looks like Jerry's got armour patrolling the city.",
  "11224244": "Fall back and regroup! Now!",
  "11224245": "Okay, lads. We need to clear that bridge before we can move forward. Engineers, get in there and deal with those mines. Everyone else, keep Jerry off their backs.",
  "11224246": "Right, let's push forward and clear out the rest of those Jerry troops. Then we can come up with a plan.",
  "11224247": "We've outflanked them! They're falling back!",
  "11224248": "Engineers, get in there and deal with those mines. The rest of you… try to do a better job of keeping 'em alive.",
  "11224249": "Right, lads. That's the artillery dealt with. Should make things a bit easier from now on.",
  "11224250": "Nice work, lads. This'll strengthen our supply lines. And it'll make Norton happy.",
  "11224251": "Keep an eye out for enemy patrols, lads. They'll be looking for us.",
  "11224252": "Incoming paratroopers!",
  "11224253": "Prepare for the second attack",
  "11224254": "Prepare for the final attack",
  "11224255": "Forests conceal companies, but are slower to move through.",
  "11224284": "The town's just over there. Jerry won't be expecting us, but things'll get very lively as soon as we show up. So make those shots count.",
  "11224285": "Argh! We'll never make it up that hill. Fall back. Maybe there's another way.",
  "11224286": "Things have been a bit too cushy for Jerry recently. Time to turn up the heat and push 'em out of this town.",
  "11224287": "Good work, lads. The town's ours.",
  "11224288": "Right lads, you heard 'im. We need to hold this position. Don't let 'em push us back.",
  "11224289": "Nice work, lads. The town's ours. Let's head back to the church and regroup.",
  "11224290": "Typical, ain't it. Our reinforcements have got 'emselves pinned down. Let's go dig 'em out of that mess.",
  "11224291": "No problem, lads. Glad to have to you here.",
  "11224292": "Right, Jerry's been using this area to store supplies. Let's \"acquire\" them shall we?",
  "11224293": "More supplies? Nice.",
  "11224294": "Good job, lads. That's all the supplies \"acquired.\"",
  "11224295": "Sir. Sir! We've got Jerry tanks heading our way.",
  "11224296": "Argh! There's a Nebelwerfer on that hill. I hate those things.",
  "11224297": "Get to cover! The Nebelwerfer's at it again!",
  "11224298": "Argh, Jerry's bringing in a mortar team.",
  "11224299": "Right, Jerry's going to be trying to retake this town. No rest for the wicked, eh? Dig in and we should be fine.",
  "11224300": "Keep your eyes peeled for paratroopers, lads. We've got Jerry aircraft inbound.",
  "11224304": "Destroy the enemy's base.",
  "11224305": "Destroy the enemy's headquarters.",
  "11224310": "All right, lads. Jerry's gonna be getting here any minute now, so we need to get in position sharpish. Don't forget, we're gonna hold that church no matter what.",
  "11224311": "This is it, lads. Jerry's making a final push. They've brought in a Tiger tank and some of their elite troops. They're heading toward the church, but if we can stop 'em, that should be enough to end this. I hope.",
  "11224312": "We've lost the outer town, lads. We've gotta push harder. Don't bottle it now!",
  "11224313": "Argh! We've lost the upper entrance to the city. Stay the course and don't lose that church!",
  "11224314": "Argh! It's no use, we can't hold 'em off. Fall back, fall back!",
  "11224315": "All right! That'll do it. Jerry's got a bloody nose and we've still got the city. Good job, lads.",
  "11224316": "Stay focused. Jerry's brought in artillery to open up our flanks. Don't let 'em get behind our defenses.",
  "11224317": "Watch our flanks! Jerry's artillery has opened up the city.",
  "11224318": "Heads up! Jerry's approaching the church. We need to keep hitting his vehicles to force a retreat.",
  "11224329": "Looks like Jerry's loading their gear onto those trucks.",
  "11224330": "It'd be a shame if anything happened to 'em.",
  "11224331": "That's one down. Keep at it, lads.",
  "11224332": "That's another truck dealt with. One more to go.",
  "11224333": "That's the last truck gone. Jerry's falling apart. Probably a lack of socks.",
  "11224334": "One of the trucks is making a break for it!",
  "11224335": "Oh no you don't! One of the trucks is falling back. Get to them before they reach those infantry.",
  "11224336": "Truck's on the move. Let's stop it in tracks… wheels… whatever. Just stop it.",
  "11224337": "Hold on… There's a Jerry convoy heading this way.",
  "11224338": "Put your ciggies out, lads. We're gonna stop 'em before they make it through the town.",
  "11224339": "Bollocks, one of the trucks got past us. Don't let that happen again, all right?",
  "11224340": "Aw, fuck! Most of the convoy made it through. Can't win 'em all I guess. Come on, let's go. Norton's gonna pissed.",
  "11224341": "Well, we got most of 'em and the rest won't get far without their socks. Let's get out of here.",

  "11224408": "Right lads. Two down one to go. Keep it tight and we'll get through this in one piece.",
  "11224409": "Alright! Nice one, lads. That's the last of the defenses.",
  "11224410": "Right, lads. Jerry's none too happy about us being here, and he's prepping for a counterattack.",
  "11224411": "Well done, lads. Jerry's falling back.",
  "11224412": "Lieutenant? Looks like Jerry's moving supplies out of a village just down the road.",
  "11224413": "Fall back to the HQ, and we'll hold them off from there.",

  "11224425": "<cough> Well, it's running, I guess. All right, that's the last of 'em. Nicely done, lads.",
  "11224426": "Look out! Jerry's got rocket artillery on the hill. We need to clear it out, pronto.",
  "11224427": "Argh, that's the M31 done for. Not much we can do without it. Pull back, lads.",
  "11224428": "<laughs> Nice one, lads. Always wanted one of these things. Should make the journey home a bit easier.",

  "11224446": "Good work, men. That's the AA gun dealt with. Now we should really go and find that captain before he gets himself into any more trouble.",
  "11224447": "Alright, I was gonna blow the AA gun up, but I guess capturing it's even better.",
  "11224448": "There they are lads. Let's go!",
  "11224449": "Jerry's sending in reinforcements, lads!",
  "11224450": "We gotta clear out the area!",
  "11224451": "Argh! We've lost the captain and the Partisans. Let's get out of here before things get even worse.",
  "11224452": "That's right, Jerry! You run back to Adolf!",
  "11224453": "Anyway, I'd better shut up or I'll be getting myself into trouble again. Come on, lads, we've got a captain to rescue.",
  "11224454": "There it is lads. Officially, that AA gun is our target. Take it out.",
  "11224455": "Argh! They got the captain! Keep going, lads. We can still save the Partisans.",
  "11224456": "Argh! We've lost the Partisans. Alright, lads, nothing we can do for 'em. Protect the captain!",
  "11224457": "Thanks for the heads up. Right then, lads. If we can take out that AA gun then it'll give us some of that plausible deniability later.",
  "11224458": "Well, that was a nightmare wasn't it? We made it, though. Good job, lads.",
  "11224459": "That's the last of 'em, lads, but we lost the captain. No one's gonna be happy after this debacle, but we tried our best.",
  "11224460": "Stuka! Take cover!",
  "11224461": "Here they come again!",
  "11224462": "You're 'aving a giraffe ain't ya! Here they come again! Keep firing, lads!",
  "11224463": "I'd have loved to have been a fly on the wall when Buckram told the commander about this mess. Surprised he authorized the mission, to be honest, but here we are.",
  "11224464": "Don't get cocky, Jerry'll be back. Check your weapons and dig in.",
  "11224465": "Keep your wits about you, lads. Jerry's not finished with us yet.",
  "11224466": "Here we are, lads. Nothing much happening at the moment but you can bet Jerry'll wake up once we come knocking.",
  "11224467": "Those Stukas look nasty. We'll wanna capture any anti-air weapons we can find to deal with them.",
  "11224468": "Alright, gather round.",
  "11224469": "Incoming! Take cover!",
  "11224470": "Nice one, lads, we've got ourselves an airfield. Jerry's gonna be spitting feathers so settle in and get ready for a counterattack.",
  "11224471": "So far, so good, lads. But Jerry's heading our way along the main road. So... let's get busy and give him a welcome he won't forget.",
  "11224472": "Argh! We've lost the airfield. Right, let's cut our losses. Pull back, lads.",
  "11224473": "Jerry's got armour on the way. Time to prep those anti-tank weapons, lads.",
  "11224474": "Incoming aircraft! Shit… they're using incendiary explosives. Keep your heads down!",
  "11224475": "Take cover! Enemy bombers!",
  "11224476": "Well done, lads. That's another airfield for our collection. Right, who's got the tea.",
  "11224477": "They've lost another plane.",
  "11224478": "Enemy aircraft down!",
  "11224479": "Good job, lads, but don't get ahead of yourselves. We need to capture both sides of the airfield.",
  "11224480": "The enemy has seized one side of the airfield. We can't let them take all of it!",
  "11224481": "The enemy is about to capture the entire airfield. We must hold on!",
  "11224482": "Allied reinforcements are inbound. We need to hold off the enemy until they arrive.",
  "11224483": "Come on, lads. Jerry's winning! We can't be having that!",
  "11224484": "Enemy troops incoming, lads. Command reckons reinforcements are on the way. We just need to stay alive till they get here.",
  "11224485": "Argh! We've lost one side of the airfield. Don't let 'em get the rest, lads.",
  "11224486": "Heh heh! Alright! Reinforcements have arrived, lads. Let's go send Jerry packing.",
  "11224490": "Our allies are pinned down. Take out the enemy firing on them.",
  "11224491": "Allied squads are taking fire. Push the enemy back!",
  "11224492": "Our allies are taking casualties.",
  "11224493": "Allied squads have taken heavy casualties.",
  "11224494": "Our allies are getting wiped out!",
  "11224495": "We lost 'em..... Get back to HQ.",
  "11224496": "The enemy is in retreat! Get our boys back to HQ.",
  "11224497": "Heads up. The Germans are mounting an assault and trying to retake the town. Prepare to defend!",
  "11224498": "Enemy infantry spotted. Here they come!",
  "11224499": "That was just the start. Reports show enemy armor is on its way. Get ready.",
  "11224500": "Enemy vehicles spotted. Destroying their armor might weaken German resolve.",
  "11224501": "Their infantry is wavering. They'll be done for if we take out one more of their tanks.",
  "11224502": "Excellent work! Victory is ours.",
  "11224503": "The town has been overrun. Fall back and regroup.",
  "11224504": "If we can't protect the outskirts then focus on the main square.",
  "11224505": "We need to stall the German advance. Focus on the remaining objectives.",
  "11224506": "I expect Jerry will send infantry to probe our lines, but they'll use armor for the main attack.",
  "11224513": "All right, lads. We are facing a battle-hardened enemy. We can break their morale by throwing everything we have at them.",
  "11224514": "But be warned: they are sure to do the same to us. You hear that, Nige?",
  "11224515": "Alright, lads, listen up. The enemy's holding three strategic locations. We must capture them and hold all three at once.",
  "11224516": "Be warned, Jerry's likely to try the same strategy.",
  "11224517": "Here's the plan, lads: we bleed their reinforcements dry by taking and holding the majority of territory.",
  "11224518": "Move fast. We may have the initiative, but they have the defensive advantage.",
  "11224519": "We're in a proper mess here, lads. Our defence hinges on three points. Hold on to them and repel the enemy. But we all know Jerry won't go down that easy.",
  "11224520": "Jerry's keen on taking this central point. Focus all your attention on protecting it.",
  "11224521": "Another setback for Jerry. Good job, lads!",
  "11224522": "Nice work! We smashed the enemy assault.",
  "11224523": "It was just a flesh wound, lads. Retreat and regroup.",
  "11224524": "Jerry has a defensive advantage, but we have the initiative of attack.",
  "11224525": "Seek out and destroy their headquarters.",
  "11224526": "The enemy is preparing an assault on our headquarters. We have the defensive advantage, so we can hold them for a while.",
  "11224527": "However, if we can eliminate their headquarters, then we can thwart their attack.",
  "11224528": "Our front line is facing a bombardment! Take cover!",
  "11224529": "Stukas! Take cover!",
  "11224530": "Enemy aircraft inbound! The Luftwaffe still has some life left after all.",
  "11224531": "Take care of those Fallschirmjäger before they gain a foothold.",
  "11224532": "Careful, it appears Jerry has mined this area.",
  "11224533": "Clear the remaining mines by any means available!",
  "11224534": "That transport lost an engine and had to abandon its cargo over enemy territory. See it that we recover it before Jerry does.",
  "11224535": "Bloody hell, the general's godson was in that last batch of reinforcements. See that he gets enough combat experience to be promoted out of here. Just make sure he doesn't die while you're at it.",
  "11224536": "The general's godson received his stripes and will be on the next truck to the rear. We're not responsible for that ninny any longer.",
  "11224537": "Looks like the general's just lost his godson. Nige, go on and deliver the news.",
  "11224538": "A crack shot sniper is active in this area. Thanks to local partisans, we have his usual positions identified, but we still have to deal with him.",
  "11224539": "The armour arrived just in time. Rumour has it this area is a training ground for new Panther crews. It'd be a shame if they were interrupted, eh, lads?",
  "11224540": "An awful lot of enemy tanks is returning to their headquarters. We must make sure they're destroyed before Jerry can repair, refuel, and return them to action.",
  "11224541": "Intel reports Jerry's field-testing a new model of Panzerschreck projectile. Let's go nick some for, you know, evaluation.",
  "11224542": "The Germans have heavy artillery support. Silence those guns!",
  "11224543": "It pains me to say, but Jerry's getting quite good at ambushing our lads. We have to deal with the brightest of their infantry before the others start catching on to their ideas.",
  "11224544": "On your feet, lads. The General is coming for a snap inspection. He should be here at any minute.",
  "11224545": "Jolly good, men, but I'm afraid this swiss cheese of a truck is unfit for taking me back to Division. I'll just return on my own.",
  "11224546": "Good grief, I could swear that truck was in proper condition. Time for a walk, I suppose.",
  "11224547": "Very well, our goal is just to confirm everything is in order. First things first: the munition supply.",
  "11224548": "Everything seems to be in order, given the circumstances. Now I'm afraid I'm expected somewhere else. Gentlemen, return to headquarters.",
  "11224549": "Next, the fuel situation. Perhaps we'll catch a glimpse of my godson; I've heard he was just recently reallocated.",
  "11224550": "Seems you have everything in order here, gentlemen. Now if you'll just show me to the troops, I would like to give out a few commendations.",
  "11224551": "I suppose you could say they died for a cause.",
  "11224552": "That's it for the official business. Now, I need a favour. I've served my whole career behind a desk—I'd love to see some action before curtains are called.",
  "11224553": "The enemy has the defensive advantage, but we have the initiative of attack.",
  "11224554": "We could force Jerry to retreat if we're able to surround their headquarters.",
  "11224555": "We have them surrounded. Now hold the ground until their morale cracks.",
  "11224556": "Call in more infantry. Jerry has broken through and we must close a pocket around their headquarters.",
  "11224557": "Jerry has cut off our headquarters. Break out, or the battle is lost!",
  "11224558": "Our defensive position is well-prepared to deal with whatever surprises Jerry has in store for us.",
  "11224559": "We've been sent an anti-tank gun with new field modifications to be tested in combat. I'm told it's more powerful, but the sights still need tuning.",
  "11224560": "Nice work, lads. Those field modifications seem promising.",
  "11224561": "The gun shield must've been too thin. I suppose I'll have to report the loss of the prototype to Division. Cover your ears...",
  "11224562": "We've received an unwanted stockpile of mines from Division. Well, as I always say, Nige: one man's trash...",
  "11224563": "We must recover a reconnaissance vehicle behind enemy lines. It has struck a mine during patrol and its crew was forced to retreat before they could destroy the radio. It's up to us to make sure it doesn't fall into enemy hands.",
  "11224564": "Good work, now let's get her back on the road!",
  "11224565": "Such a waste of a good vehicle, but at least the radio was destroyed.",
  "11224566": "Party's over, lads. Our vanguard went too far and now Jerry knows we're here.",
  "11224567": "Reinforcements are limited, but if we strike hard with what we have, Jerry may waiver.",
  "11224568": "The Germans have launched their attack before our main force could move into position.",
  "11224569": "Reinforcements are short, so focus on defending our strongpoints. With any luck, we can stop their advance.",
  "11224570": "We broke their spirit! The Germans are in retreat.",
  "11224571": "Retreat! The Germans have stalled our attack.",
  "11224572": "Jerry broke through our defenses! Retreat!",
  "11224573": "Reinforcements have arrived. Put them to good use.",
  "11224574": "One last batch of reinforcements. It's all we could spare.",
  "11224575": "We are down to one strongpoint! Defend it all cost!",
  "11224576": "Nice work! Only one enemy strongpoint remains.",
  "11224577": "The enemy is in retreat. Destroying their headquarters wasn't part of the plan but it has forced them from the field.",
  "11224578": "Move it, move it, move it! We've got enemy forces incoming!",
  "11224579": "Jerry's transport planes have been spotted heading our way. They're gonna be dropping paratroopers behind our lines.\\r\\nGet a move on then!",
  "11224580": "Get those anti-air defenses manned. We can't lose this port!",
  "11224581": "Jerry's gonna try and keep us pinned down. Keep your wits about ya and watch out for enemy paratroopers. They're going to be landing right in our laps.",
  "11224582": "Here we go, lads. Enemy paratroopers inbound!",
  "11224583": "Good job, lads. Jerry's had enough and he's heading home to lick his wounds.",
  "11224584": "Argh! They've captured the supply yard. Fall back! We have to protect the port!",
  "11224585": "Come on, lads! We've lost the anti-air! Pull back and don't let them take the port!",
  "11224586": "That's it, Jerry's overrunning the port! Get to the boats while you still can!",
  "11224587": "Allied Aircraft! Support is here!",
  "11224590": "We've got a German officer en route to the manor and our job is to make sure he doesn't get there.",
  "11224591": "First, we take down the enemy squads guarding the area. Quick and quiet. Then we wait for him to show.",
  "11224592": "We'll need to hit the target before he gets inside. Once he goes down, we get the hell out of here. Fast.",
  "11224593": "Grenadiers ahead. Take em' out fast, or stay outta sight.",
  "11224594": "We've got enemies incoming!",
  "11224595": "Man down! Dammit.",
  "11224596": "The target is on approach. Get into position.",
  "11224597": "Target is in the AO. Hold steady and wait for a clear shot.",
  "11224598": "Target down! Jerry'll be on our asses now so let's get out of here.",
  "11224599": "Move! Move! Move!",
  "11224600": "Let's get the hell outta here!",
  "11224601": "Location cleared. Keep moving.",
  "11224602": "Area clear.",
  "11224603": "Enemy neutralized.",
  "11224604": "Dammit, the target's reached the manor… We're done here.",
  "11224605": "They're on to us. Take out the guards before they call in reinforcements.",
  "11224606": "They know we're here. Looks like the entire Kraut army's heading our way.",
  "11224607": "German reinforcements incoming!",
  "11224608": "The target's been alerted. Take him out any way you can!",
  "11224609": "Nice job. Now we set up an ambush and wait.",
  "11224610": "Good work. Let's get out of here, boys.",
  "11224611": "Target down! Time to go.",
  "11224612": "Target's down. Now we just need to get out of here.",
  "11224613": "First squad's down. Keep moving.",
  "11224614": "Enemy squad down.",
  "11224615": "We've got 'em all.",
  "11224684": "A major German offensive is approaching the area, and allied units remain pinned down. Help them break contact before they're overrun!",
  "11224685": "You've got to protect those engineers while they repair the Greyhound!",
  "11224686": "Well done, airborne. Take the Greyhound with you.",
  "11224687": "The engineers are down! Double time it to the other engagements.",
  "11224688": "We need to eliminate some artillery spotters to allow a safe retreat. Lead the assault, airborne!",
  "11224689": "The enemy artillery is retreating. An additional airborne squad has joined us to tackle the next position.",
  "11224690": "Objective failed, continue the operation before more Artillery arrives.",
  "11224691": "Reports of a nearby Panzer IV. Get ready airborne, we can't have that thing chasing our back line.",
  "11224692": "Armor down! We're getting our men out of there.",
  "11224693": "It's too late, the enemy has overrun this position!",
  "11224694": "We've broken contact as best we could. Get your forces out of here. Two scout units have joined us to lead the way.",
  "11224695": "You've saved lives today, airborne! We'll push the Germans back another day, at full strength.",
  "11224696": "We've lost too many squads, commander. The day belongs to the enemy.",
  "11224697": "Our forces are pinned down by those artillery batteries.",
  "11224698": "If we don't hurry up and deal with them our lads'll be wiped out.",
  "11224699": "We've engaged the enemy.  They're going to try and call for help!  Stop that vehicle from transmitting!",
  "11224700": "Signals vehicle destroyed!  They'll be confused for a bit.  Time to hit hard!",
  "11224701": "Alright, that battery's neutralized. Good work.",
  "11224702": "The battery's been neutralised. Good job, lads.",
  "11224703": "Jerry's bringing in reinforcements. Don't let 'em catch ya with ya drawers down, lads.",
  "11224704": "Jerry's sending reinforcements!",
  "11224705": "Get ready, lads! Jerry's trying to retake those guns.",
  "11224706": "Come on! Our lads are suffering heavy losses. We need to hurry up and take out those guns.",
  "11224707": "We're getting there, lads. Allied forces are starting to break through.",
  "11224708": "Look at that lads, Jerry's retreating again. They're making a habit of it, ain't they?",
  "11224709": "It's no good, lads. Our goose is cooked. Pull back! Maybe Valenti can find a way through.",
  "11224710": "We've failed to stop the transmission!  The main enemy force has been notified of our location!",
  "11224711": "Jerry's set up a bunch of strongpoints across the town. If we can take 'em out then that'll give our lads the opportunity to push forward.",
  "11224712": "Lieutenant. We've made contact with an Italian Liberation Corps motorized combat group. They've agreed to help you in your fight.",
  "11224713": "We've received word that the enemy is sending recon in force to try and dislodge us from the ridge, led by a signals vehicle.",
  "11224714": "Try to neutralize it - it may prove to be a thorn in our side.",
  "11224715": "Watch out!  Incoming German air support!",
  "11224716": "We've received word that the Germans are sending recon in force to try and dislodge us from the ridge, led by a signals vehicle.",
  "11224717": "Take it out before it becomes a thorn in our side!",
  "11224718": "We've got enemy aircraft incoming!",
  "11224719": "The signals vehicle is transmitting our location!  Take it out!",
  "11224720": "We've failed to stop the transmission!  Enemy air units are enroute!",

  "11224724": "Jerry's approaching the western gun, lads! We've gotta stop 'em before they get there.",
  "11224726": "It ain't here. Maybe Norton was right and this is a wild- Hold on, hold on. Jackpot! Here it is, lads.",
  "11224727": "Butterfingers has dropped the machine! <pause> Well pick it up, you idiot!",
  "11224728": "Okay, we got the machine back. Try to hang on to it this time.",
  "11224729": "Jerry's got the Enigma machine! Get it back!",
  "11224730": "Argh, Jerry's got the machine. Time to cut our losses. Fall back, lads!",
  "11224731": "All right, lads, we're here. Valenti's bloke reckons this Enigma wotsit is in one of the houses in that village.",
  "11224732": "Argh, Jerry's here already. I thought we'd have more time than that. Get moving to that extraction point. Now!",

  "11224750": "We've lost part of the airfield. We need to take it back!",
  "11224751": "Ah, come on lads, we've lost a good chunk of the airfield. We need to take it back!",
  "11224752": "Look out, there's an 88 over there!",
  "11224753": "Careful, men. The Krauts have an 88!",
  "11224754": "Okay, don't panic, but there's an 88 over there. Let's be careful how we deal with that one.",
  "11224755": "Jerry's coming across the bridges! Look lively, lads. It's about to get messy.",
  "11224756": "Right. Jerry's got his artillery zeroed on this side of the bridge. That means you're gonna want to stay well clear so that you don't get a shell on your noggin. We need to build up our defenses, though, so don't just sit around twiddling your thumbs, eh Nige?",
  "11224757": "Okay, those tanks Norton mentioned are almost here. We'll need as much anti-tank support as we can get.",
  "11224758": "Jerry's just testing our defenses, lads, looking for weaknesses. We've relocated our heavy artillery up onto the hill overlooking the city. Best we use those guns for support where we need it.",
  "11224759": "Artillery! Stay back and get those defenses shored up. Jerry'll be bringing in his tanks any minute now.",
  "11224760": "All right! Jerry's had enough of losing his tanks and he's pulling back. Nicely done, lads.",
  "11224761": "The airfield's ours. Good job, men.",
  "11224762": "Good job, lads. The airfield's ours.",
  "11224763": "We've got enemy forces incoming along the main road. Set up defensive positions.",
  "11224764": "Jerry's heading our way along the main road. Let's get some defensive positions set up.",
  "11224765": "That's it. The airfield's ours. That should calm Buckram down.",
  "11224766": "There we go, lads, airfield's ours. Told you it'd be a piece of cake, didn't I, Nige?",
  "11224767": "Dammit! The Krauts have taken the airfield. Fall back, men. We'll find another way.",
  "11224768": "Ah, fuck it! We've lost the airfield. Fall back, lads, and I'll give Buckram the bad news.",
  "11224769": "The Krauts have nearly captured the airfield. We need to push back, now!",
  "11224770": "Come on, lads! We need to hit back, now!",

  "11224782": "We're on our own for this one and there're more German forces on the way. So, let's get in quick, find that machine, and then leg it.",
  "11224791": "Good job, lads. The boffins back at HQ are gonna love this.",
  "11224792": "Right, we've got the Enigma machine. Now we just need to get to that extraction point before the rest of the Germans arrive.",
  "11224793": "Well, that's not how I wanted things to go. They were a good bunch of lads, that lot.",
  "11224796": "If Jerry brings in his armour, it'll be a sticky wicket for us. Perhaps we can capture one of their anti-tank guns to bolster our defences.",

  "11224881": "Look lively, lads, we've got enemy infantry on the way.",
  "11224882": "Okay, don't panic, Nige, but there's more armour on the way and they're bringing infantry in support. Get those anti-tank weapons prepped.",

  "11224885": "We've lost the northern point! Jerry'll be pushing towards the town soon. Keep your wits about ya, lads.",
  "11224886": "Argh! Jerry's just taken the eastern point. Come on, lads. We need to stop 'em, pronto.",

  "11224924": "Just a few more supplies left. This'll give Jerry a right headache.",
  "11224925": "I'll tell you what. If we can't have it nobody can. New objective… destroy Jerry's supplies.",
  "11224926": "Jerry knows we're here! Heavy reinforcements on the way.",
  "11224927": "Good job, lads. Not what we set out to do, but it'll slow Jerry down for a bit.",
  "11224928": "Jerry's forces are too strong! Fall back, lads. We've done what we can.",
  "11224929": "That's it, lads. Time to scarper!",

  "11224944": "Jerry armour incoming from the north! Destroy those tanks and secure this side of the bridge. Well go on, then!",
  "11224945": "Boom! That's one down.",
  "11224946": "Alright, just one more to go.",
  "11224947": "Nice! Jerry's pulling back.",
  "11224948": "Good work, lads. We held the town and the commandos finally found that intel. It's probably just Hitler's shopping list, of course, but still… they got it. That's what matters.",
  "11224949": "Things are looking pretty bad for those commandos. I guess it's a good job we got here when we did.",
  "11224950": "Alright, you heard him. We're gonna hold this town until the lads up there find whatever it is they're looking for. Jerry's gonna be coming across the bridges so let's start by getting set up there.",
  "11224951": "Argh! Jerry's targeting the commandos with artillery. Well come on, then. Someone find that gun!",
  "11224952": "Come on, lads! Those commandos are taking a right hammering!",
  "11224953": "Those commandos can't hold out much longer. We need to get to them. Fast!",
  "11224954": "That's one down. Two more to go.",
  "11224955": "Yeah. Alright, that's the second one done for.",

  "11224961": "Jerry's bringing their armour up the hill. If we can destroy enough of their vehicles maybe they'll see the error of their ways and retreat.",
  "11224962": "Argh! We've lost the church. We have to stop them taking the town! Hit 'em with everything we've got.",
  "11224963": "Jerry's taken over the outer town. If they get up the hill we're done for! We have to push 'em back!",
  "11224964": "Right, lads. Jerry's on his way. We need to hold 'em off until our reinforcements get here.",
  "11224965": "Looks like our first lot of reinforcements have arrived. Welcome to Potenza, lads. I hope you brought plenty of ammo.",

  "11225449": "Good evening, Clarence. I hear you employed a professional magician to secure victory in North Africa. You'll need more than trickery to defeat the German Army this time.",
  "11225450": "Do you miss London, Clarence? Because the Luftwaffe never do.",
  "11225451": "General Norton, my good friend. Don't forget you promised to drop by when you reach Rome. I have a very special present waiting for you.",

  "11226106": "There's a lot riding on this one. Capturing Salerno is critical to our success in Italy. Corporal Conti will take it from here. Good luck.",
  "11226107": "Your goal today is to retake Ortona. German forces are dug in deep so you're goinna have to remove them street by street.",
  "11226108": "You'll need to reclaim these three intersections and clear a route through the city.",
  "11226109": "The Germans have blocked off the streets, but we have a heavy vehicle on the way to help you break through.",
  "11226110": "Once the main route is clear, move forward and push the Germans out.",
  "11226111": "Canadian forces are already in the city, and they'll cover your flanks as you advance. This one's going to be tough so keep your heads down and don't take risks. Good luck, men.",
  "11226112": "I've got one word for you. Potenza. If we can capture the city we'll have a solid base to push north toward Rome.",
  "11226113": "The Luftwaffe have set up defensive positions at these three locations. You're going to take control of those points.",
  "11226114": "They've brought in substantial forces to protect the city, including snipers.",
  "11226115": "So, stay alert and take it slow. Rushing in is just gonna get you killed.",
  "11226116": "Your goal today is to take control of Foggia. The control tower is the heart of the airfield. We hold that, we hold Foggia.",
  "11226117": "The Germans have set up defenses around the tower, and they've already got planes in the air.",
  "11226118": "The scouts we helped out believe the Germans are storing valuable intel in the buildings to the west of the control tower. If so, you should try to get your hands on it.",
  "11226119": "The control tower is our main objective, though, don't forget that. We need this airfield. Okay, good luck men.",
  "11226120": "The railway gun at Anzio is hammering our troops as they try to land on the beaches. We need you to shut it down before we lose this offensive.",
  "11226121": "German forces are set up along the ridge of the hill and in the gullies leading to the town.",
  "11226122": "Breaking through at either of those points should allow you to move into the town itself.",
  "11226123": "Once you've done that you can move on to the gun. The quicker you capture it, the more lives you save.",
  "11226124": "Once you've secured the town and shut down the gun, Anzio's ours. Okay, Corporal Conti, over to you.",
  "11226125": "Many of you were here last year when we laid siege to Tobruk for 241 days. The British had plenty of time to bolster their defenses along the ridge outside of the city. However, due to our recent efforts, their forces are scattered, and they were not expecting us...",
  "11226127": "It is now clear that storming Tobruk today was the correct move. We should be able to break through their first and second line of defenses with ease, forcing them to withdraw to the city.",
  "11226128": "We will then advance and secure the roads leading out, trapping the British forces there. They will have no choice but to surrender.",
  "11226129": "Mark my words: Tobruk's port and supply depots will finally be ours before the end of the morning. Mobilize the camera crews; today we make history.",
  "11226130": "Afrikakorps, we find ourselves right in the middle of the lion's den. The British not only had plenty of time to prepare their defenses in the area, but are also now aware of our location.",
  "11226131": "However, our base is protected by their own minefield, and we have finally cleared a path forward. There is no better time for an offensive.",
  "11226132": "They have complete control of the fortification to the north, but thanks to your recon efforts, we now know it has two entrances. To take them, we must break through their defenses along the roads and ridges on our way there.",
  "11226133": "Once those locations are secured, our originally disadvantageous positioning will suddenly turn into an advantage. We'll no longer be trapped with them. They will be trapped with us.",
  "11226134": "Keep an eye out for any remaining mines on the field, but otherwise... this cauldron has simmered for long enough.",
  "11226137": "If I could speak with you for a moment, Commander. The men... well they're tired. But I know a guy who might be able to help. If you could convince the Navy to bring one of their ships to Barletta, he can rustle us up some ice cream. I think the men would really appreciate it.",

  "11226139": "Sir, I'm told the Americans intend to provide ice cream for their troops. I really don't see the value in such frivolous actions.",
  "11226140": "Sir, I hear the Americans intend to distribute ice cream to their troops. Never liked the stuff, myself, but each to his own.",
  "11226141": "Sir, the Americans appear to be planning to give their troops ice cream of all things. This really is an absurd misuse of military resources.",
  "11226142": "Okay, men. Thanks to our theatre commander, I've lined up some delicious ice cold treats for everyone on leave at Barletta. Get 'em while they're cold.",
  "11226143": "There we go, men. Ice cream all around.",
  "11226144": "Don't quite know why, but Conti's got us all some ice cream courtesy of the United States army. Not my favourite flavour but never mind. Dig in, lads.",
  "11226145": "Looks like we've missed the ship. The ice cream'll have to wait until Rome.",
  "11226146": "Argh. The damn Krauts have destroyed our ice cream barge. If I didn't want to shoot 'em before, I do now.",
  "11226147": "You know, Italians make very good ice cream without the need for expensive military ships.",
  "11226148": "Ice cream, Commander?  I'm glad to see the Allies have their priorities straight.",
  "11226149": "Ice cream, Commander. Do your men not have better things to do?",
  "11226150": "My men do seem to appreciate the ice cream, sir. Personally, I think it's ghastly stuff, but I suppose there's no accounting for taste.",

  "11226750": "Right, men. The Brass are looking to move supplies through this area, but the Krauts have other plans. They've fortified the crossroads and brought in heavy armor to stop us. That's why you're here.",
  "11226751": "We need you to clear out their bunkers and artillery to open up the crossroads.",
  "11226752": "They'll have heavy armor protecting the major roads, so you'll have to deal with that, too.",

  "11229905": "Jerry's cornered, lads, and you know what they say about cornered rats. They're gonna put up a hell of a fight, but the world's counting on us, and we've come too far to give up now. Alright, speeches over. Let's go.",
  "11229906": "Okay, lads, deep breaths. We're almost there. Just one more push and this'll all be over.",
  "11229907": "Jerry's set up a defensive line here. To break it, we need to take out these strongpoints. He'll have Flak 88s too, and you know how much I love them.",

  "11229931": "A little birdie told me that Jerry's stationed near the bridges. We also know that they've got heavy artillery. It never rains but it pours, eh? Okay, those commandos'll be getting tired by now. Let's go give 'em a hand.",

  "11229947": "Right, that's it, lads. Let's go.",
  "11229948": "Okay, lads, we need to capture Foggia. The control tower is the heart of the airfield. We hold that, we hold Foggia.",
  "11229949": "Jerry's well aware of that fact, so he's set up defenses around the tower, and he's got planes in the air just waiting for us to show our faces.",

  "11229959": "The Krauts have left piles of ammunition just lying around. All you need to do is get in there and grab it. The bulk of their forces are on patrol so we're not expecting a lot of resistance.",

  "11229965": "Jerry's not going to just let us waltz up the hill, unfortunately. Allied artillery will be bombarding their line to soften 'em up but it's still going to be an uphill battle. Pun intended.",
  "11229966": "Jerry's forces have retreated to Hotel Continental. That place'll make a good forward barracks. So, if we can, we should capture it.",
  "11229967": "From there, we'll head up to the abbey itself. Jerry'll be there waiting for us. He's got artillery, too, and we can expect him to put it to good use while we climb the hill.",
  "11229968": "Allied bombing runs have destroyed a lot of the buildings so there'll be plenty of cover for Jerry's troops. We won't be able to use vehicles up there, so it'll be down to the infantry to get the job done.",
  "11229969": "There are Partisans out there somewhere as well. We should help them if we can. They got caught in the bombing so it's the least we can do, I reckon.",
  "11229970": "There's no two ways about it, lads. This is gonna hurt. Keep your heads down, stay sharp, and don't get shot. I'll see you at the top.",
  "11229973": "Although our final objective is the MONASTERY GROUNDS, we must first advance through the town. Allied bombardment will give us some covering fire.  Be advised that with the TOWN HALL captured, the Germans have fallen back to defensive positions around HOTEL CONTINENTAL.",
  "11229974": "From there, we'll head up to the abbey itself. Jerry'll be there waiting for us.",
  "11229975": "Our Polish friends are moving towards the abbey as well. If all goes according to plan they'll meet us at the top and we can kick Jerry out together.",
  "11229976": "There's no two ways about it, lads. This is gonna hurt. Keep your heads down, stay sharp, and don't get shot. I'll see you at the top.",
  "11229977": "Quiet lads. Okay, Jerry's using this town as their base of operations for the region, and Sergeant MacKay needs us to do something about it.",
  "11229978": "We're gonna head into the town and clear out all of Jerry's forces.",
  "11229979": "All right, this should be nice and straightforward. Our lads had a bit of a dust up with Jerry last night. Norton claims it was a draw but either way we had to leave a few damaged tanks behind.",
  "11229980": "Jerry's pretty much cleared out so we're going to take an M31 recovery vehicle in and reclaim anything that isn't too wrecked to be useful.",
  "11229981": "Personally, I'd love to see us bag one of Jerry's tanks as well. If you see any, give us a shout.",
  "11229985": "Lieutenant? We're going to need more time to find this intel.",

  "11230001": "All right, listen up, lads. Jerry's got his eye on Ortona again. We lost a lot of good men capturing this city, we're not gonna let Jerry take it back.",
  "11230002": "There's a church near our barracks. We need to hold it at all costs.",
  "11230003": "But if we can make a stand at the outer edge of the town then we'll stop Jerry before they even see the church.",
  "11230004": "Mines'll slow 'em down and buy us time so let's get some placed on the central roads. Anti-tank weapons'll come in handy as well.",
  "11230005": "Oh, and we'll need to watch our flanks. Jerry can be very sneaky. All right, that's about it. Let's get this city secured.",
  "11230007": "German forces are going to try and make it over the BRIDGES and up towards the TOWN",

  "11230012": "If that's not bad enough for ya, there are paratroopers on the way. US",
  "11230013": "If we're gonna get through this we need to keep our anti-air defenses up and running and make sure Jerry doesn't take the supply yard. US",

  "11244538": "We can't just rely on supply lines, Clarence. The problems the Krauts are having just show how vulnerable they can be.",
  "11244539": "Don't be ridiculous, Clarence. We've been following your dull but steady strategy since we got here.",
  "11244540": "I'll admit, I was skeptical, but your strategy seems to be paying off. So far, anyway.",
  "11244541": "I think that was General Norton's point all along.",
  "11244542": "I think that was Clarence's point all along, General.",
  "11244543": "Sir, we are in a somewhat precarious position regarding supplies. We should endeavour to capture ports, airfields, and any other supply points we find. Doing so will both strengthen our position and weaken the enemy's.",
  "11244544": "General Norton's right, Commander. We can't leave our men on the front lines without support.",
  "11244545": "We need to find a balance, General. The more time we give the Germans to prepare, the more painful this is gonna get.",
  "11244546": "Sir, we are in a somewhat precarious position regarding supplies. We must endeavour to capture ports, airfields, and any other supply points we find. Doing so will both strengthen our position and weaken the enemy's.",
  "11244547": "Sir, we are still in a precarious position regarding supplies. It is crucial that we capture more supply points as soon as possible. The stronger our supply lines are, the more advantage we have over the Germans.",
  "11244548": "Rumor has it, these supply lines of yours are bringing you Scotch. That would certainly explain why you're so keen on 'em.",
  "11244549": "General Buckram. Some of our troops are struggling with a lack of supplies. I wonder if one of our airfields might be able to ease their troubles?",
  "11244550": "We'd be happy to help, General. Just tell our flyboys where to drop the supplies and we'll get 'em out there.",
  "11244551": "If we've got an airfield in range then we can get a transport plane out there to drop supplies.",
  "11244552": "General Buckram, some of our troops have strayed out of supply range. Would one of our airfields be able to provide assistance?",
  "11244553": "Commander, some of the men have moved beyond the range of our supply lines. We should find a way to relieve them as soon as possible.",
  "11244554": "So you're starting see the value of airfields, Clarence? If we've got one in range then maybe we can get a transport plane out there to drop supplies.",
  "11244555": "You know, Norton, we have transport planes designed for just this situation.",
  "11244556": "We can probably help with that, General. If we've got an airfield in range then we can get a transport plane out there to drop supplies.",
  "11244557": "We can help you there, General. Just tell our flyboys where to drop the supplies and we'll get 'em out there.",
  "11244558": "Sir, the Germans are extending their supply lines and weakening ours in the process. We should recapture the lost supply points as soon as possible.",
  "11244559": "Sir, the Germans have weakened our supply lines. Inadequate support will limit our ability to deploy troops. We must push back as soon as possible.",
  "11244560": "Sir, the enemy continues to disrupt our supplies. I'm sure you understand the importance of recapturing lost supply points as soon as possible.",
  "11244561": "I think everyone knows how important you think supplies are by now, Norton.",
  "11244562": "Sir, judicious use of supply caches would enable our men to remain out of supply for longer.",
  "11244563": "And of course, destroying any enemy caches we discover would lessen the effectiveness of German troops.",
  "11244564": "We've got bombs that can take care of those caches if you want 'em, Commander.",
  "11244565": "It's not a terrible idea, Commander. But we can't lose sight of our ultimate goal.",
  "11244566": "There'd be value in that, Commander. Another port would give us more access to more forces and strengthen our supply lines.\\r\\nI can't quite believe I just said that.",
  "11244567": "Nor can I, General.",
  "11244568": "There is some wisdom in General Buckram's suggestion, Commander. The Germans do appear to be on the back foot.",
  "11244569": "Now would seem an appropriate time to do so. What with the Germans being on their back foot.",
  "11244570": "More supplies, Norton? I hope you're gonna make good use of 'em.",
  "11244571": "Sir. The Germans are building a new defensive line. We should push forward while we still can.",
  "11244572": "The time we spent was an investment, General. We would not be in a position to be successful had we just run headlong into the German lines.",
  "11244573": "That \"hanging around\" is what keeps our men alive, General.",
  "11244574": "War never is, General.",
  "11244575": "The Krauts have built up a substantial defensive line along four towns near the Volturno river. We need to hit them hard.",
  "11244576": "Commander, the Germans are making good progress on the Volturno line defenses.",
  "11244577": "We're seeing the same thing, sir. It may be time to advance more rapidly.",
  "11244578": "The Krauts have nearly finished their defenses along the Voturno Line. If we don't start our attack soon, we may as well go home.",
  "11244579": "I share General Buckram's sense of urgency, sir. Now is the time to act.",
  "11244580": "The Germans have finished the defenses at the Volturno line, Commander. It's gonna take all we've got to break through it now.",

  "11244586": "Norton's right, Commander. Anzio's gonna be a disaster if we don't take that port quickly.",
  "11244587": "He's right, Commander. Anzio's gonna be a disaster if we don't get more men in there soon.",
  "11244588": "He's right, Commander. Anzio's gonna be a clusterfuck if we don't get more men in there soon.",
  "11244589": "We'll do better in future, General.",
  "11244590": "That is good news, General. I didn't always see the value in your approach, but our ports are proving essential.",
  "11244591": "I concur. We need to deal with this threat as soon as possible.",
  "11244592": "Anzio Annie's hit us again. Sir, we must neutralize that gun.",
  "11244594": "I thought you liked a challenge, General.",
  "11244595": "Capturing Ortona will give us access to another port, General.",
  "11244596": "Oh, I do, Clarence. You should know that by now.",
  "11244597": "Yeah, yeah, I know. Supply lines. Yada yada yada.",
  "11244598": "I'm beginning to smell victory in Italy, General.",
  "11244599": "Congratulations, Commander. It seems Italy may soon be back in the hands of its people.",
  "11244600": "Henry is correct, sir. The additional airfield would prove invaluable.",
  "11244601": "I agree with the General, sir. Another airfield would prove invaluable.",
  "11244602": "We can't win them all, Henry. You'll get another crack at them soon.",
  "11244603": "We can't win every battle, General. There will be other opportunities.",
  "11244604": "We can't win them all, General. Although the occasional victory would be welcome.",
  "11244605": "Foggia's ours, Commander. We keep on like this and we'll reach Rome in no time.",
  "11244606": "That's excellent news, General. Please congratulate your men for me.",

  "11244614": "That's a very colourful way of putting it, General. But... yes, Italy will soon be under Allied control.",
  "11244615": "I wouldn't put it exactly like that, but yes, this victory is important.",
  "11244616": "And the control of its people... Yes?",
  "11244617": "Of course, Miss Valenti.",

  "11246564": "After years of violent struggle against the Italian colonizers, Libya became a battlefield once again in 1940 when Italian forces clashed with the British and their allies.\\r\\n\\nThen in February 1941, the Führer sent one of his favourite commanders, Erwin Rommel, to lead the newly formed Deutsches Afrikakorps. He was to help the Italians defend against the British. That was all.\\r\\n\\nLess than a year later, the British were in retreat and Rommel was driving the Afrikakorps towards Benghazi. And my home.",
  "11246565": "We met up with the British forces near Mechili. They were tired but friendly. They had their tea and their porters to make them feel at home, but the war was already taking its toll.\\r\\n\\nWater and food were running low, and the desert was as much their enemy as the Germans were.\\r\\n\\nThe British knew Rommel. He made them nervous. It didn't take long for me to understand why.",
  "11246566": "The British began to refer to Rommel as \"The Desert Fox.\" For some, the name conjured up images of a wily commander using stealth and cunning to outwit his opponents.\\r\\n\\nBut the British had the upper hand at Gazala. They were convinced that more troops and a strong defensive position would keep the Fox at bay.",
  "11246567": "We kept fighting. It was all we could do. But it was as though Rommel could read our minds. He seemed to always be one step ahead.\\r\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the British camp became tense. Tempers were frayed. And I was beginning to feel like I'd joined a lost cause.",
  "11246568": "Opportunities to take the fight to Rommel were rare, and we seized them whenever they appeared.\\r\\n\\nEven when we were able to push the Germans back, they made us pay for that success. Our victories were small, but they gave us hope we could cling to as the war raged on.",
  "11246569": "Rommel's tactics were unpredictable and reckless, but even the Allies claimed to admire him. They seemed to want him to be seen as a formidable opponent.\\r\\n\\nI still don't know whether that was an excuse for their losses or to amplify their glory when they finally defeated him.",
  "11246570": "The desert treated both sides of the war equally harshly.\\r\\n\\nSandstorms brought our equipment to a standstill. Sickness depleted our ranks. What few wells hadn't been sabotaged by one side or the other provided barely enough water to survive the sweltering heat.\\r\\n\\nThe Germans put on theatre shows to distract the soldiers. The British drank their tea and played chess.\\r\\n\\nBoth armies' resources were stretched too thin. Every drop of fuel was precious and the fox became a scavenger.",
  "11246571": "Among the equipment captured by the Australians was a novel the Germans had used to pass coded information from a spy in Cairo.\\r\\n\\nThe spy escaped but with the keys to Rommel's intelligence in their hands, the British could at last see a way to defeat the Germans.\\r\\n\\nBut first, we had to face the Desert Fox at El Alamein.",

  "11263293": "After the armistice between Italy and the Allies was announced on the 8th of September 1943, the Germans executed Operation Achse and attacked their former comrades all across Italy. This galvanized the anti-fascist movements in Italy into open, armed resistance.",

  "11263295": "Historian Lee Windsor, who has studied the battle for Potenza and walked the ground, describes the initial attack by the rifle companies of the West Novas as one that “sacrificed the stealth of a footborne approach for the speed of using trucks.” Unfortunately, mines blocked this approach and sacrificed surprise.",

  "11263328": "On the 20th December, 1943 the 1st Canadian Infantry Division entered Ortona and began a bloody, close quarters campaign to take the city. The Germans destroyed buildings to create roadblocks and cover. The Canadians responded by developing tactics such as \"mouse-holing\" where they assaulted German positions by attacking through the walls of buildings rather than go around them. Though the battle lasted only a week the brutality of the fighting, and ruin of the city earned it the name \"Italian Stalingrad\" among those who fought there.",
  "11263329": "Italy: Defend Ortona",
  "11263330": "Ortona was the Eastern anchor along the coast for the Gustav Line. It also provided a port for ever more Allied troops and supplies to make their way onto the Italian mainland. Keeping it out of Allied hands was key to the German defense of the region.",

Water and food were running low, and the desert was as much their enemy as the Germans were. The British knew Rommel. He made them nervous. It didn't take long to understand why.",
  "11263348": "The British Began to refer to Rommel as \"The Desert Fox.\" For some, the name conjured up images of a wily commander using stealth and cunning to outwit his opponents. But the British had the upper hand at Gazala. They were convinced that more troops and a strong defensive position would keep the Fox at bay.",
  "11263349": "We kept fighting. It was all we could do. But it was as though Rommel could read our minds. He seemed to always be one step ahead. The atmosphere in the British camp became tense. Tempers were frayed. And I was beginning to feel like I'd joined a lost cause.",
  "11263350": "Opportunities to take the fight to Rommel were rare, and we seized them whenever they appeared. Even when we were able to push the Germans back, they made us pay for that success. Our victories were small, but they gave us hope we could cling to as the war raged on.",
  "11263351": "Rommel's tactics were unpredictable and reckless, but even the Allies clamied to admire him. They seemed to want him to be seen as a formidable opponent. I still don't know whether that was an excuse for their losses or to amplify their glory when they finally defeated him.",
  "11263352": "The desert treated both sides of the war equally harshly. Sandstorms brought our equipment to a standstill. Sickness depleted our ranks. What few wells hadn't been sabotaged by one side or the other provided barely enough water to survive the sweltering heat. The Germans put on theatre shows to distract the soldiers. The British drank their tea and played chess. Both armies' resources were stretched too thin. Every drop of fuel was precious and the Fox became a scavenger.",
  "11263353": "Among the equipment captured by the Australians was a novel the Germans had used to pass coded information from a spy in Cairo. The spy escaped but with the keys to Rommel's intelligence in their hands, the British could at least see a way to defeat the Germans. But first, we had to face the Desert Fox at El Alamein.",
