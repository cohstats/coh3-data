    "11244239": "Beware anti-air! Flak weapons are effective against aircraft and can down your planes before they drop their payload.",
    "11244240": "Consider paradropping units in your HQ territory if the enemy has anti-air weaponry. Better they land safe than risk being shot down en route.",

    "11244254": "Use Hold Fire to prevent camouflaged units from giving away their position. This can make all the difference when using Snipers, who are one shot away from being prey.",
    "11244255": "Heavy Machine Guns are most effective when supported. Suppressed enemy infantry cannot easily avoid Mortar barrages, for example.",
    "11244256": "Pinned infantry squads actually take reduced damage for a short while. Use a Pinned squad to draw enemy fire while you flank.",
    "11244257": "When a squad is no longer being Suppressed, they will slowly recover. Sometimes it is better to remain Pinned than retreat.",
    "11244258": "Mines and Demolition Charges can create chain reactions of explosives. Use them in close proximity to create a larger blast radius.",
    "11244259": "Some units can recover destroyed vehicles, including enemy tanks. This will still cost you resources and take a long time, but is a worthy investment.",
    "11244260": "Reconnaissance units, such as the Kettenkrad or Scout Squad, can capture territory faster than other units.",
    "11244262": "Neutralizing enemy territory can be an effective way of denying resources to your opponent. If you can't have the resources, nobody can.",
    "11244263": "Use smoke to obscure your units or blind the enemy. Firing smoke at enemy machine guns can prevent them from firing.",
    "11244264": "White Phosphorus (or Willy Pete) grenades and shells generate smoke that obscures your units, but also burns anyone within its area of effect. Be careful!",

    "11246564": "After years of violent struggle against the Italian colonizers, Libya became a battlefield once again in 1940 when Italian forces clashed with the British and their allies.\\r\\n\\nThen in February 1941, the F\u00fchrer sent one of his favourite commanders, Erwin Rommel, to lead the newly formed Deutsches Afrikakorps. He was to help the Italians defend against the British. That was all.\\r\\n\\nLess than a year later, the British were in retreat and Rommel was driving the Afrikakorps towards Benghazi. And my home.",
    "11246565": "We met up with the British forces near Mechili. They were tired but friendly. They had their tea and their porters to make them feel at home, but the war was already taking its toll.\\r\\n\\nWater and food were running low, and the desert was as much their enemy as the Germans were.\\r\\n\\nThe British knew Rommel. He made them nervous. It didn't take long for me to understand why.",
    "11246566": "The British began to refer to Rommel as \"The Desert Fox.\" For some, the name conjured up images of a wily commander using stealth and cunning to outwit his opponents.\\r\\n\\nBut the British had the upper hand at Gazala. They were convinced that more troops and a strong defensive position would keep the Fox at bay.",
    "11246567": "We kept fighting. It was all we could do. But it was as though Rommel could read our minds. He seemed to always be one step ahead.\\r\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the British camp became tense. Tempers were frayed. And I was beginning to feel like I'd joined a lost cause.",
    "11246568": "Opportunities to take the fight to Rommel were rare, and we seized them whenever they appeared.\\r\\n\\nEven when we were able to push the Germans back, they made us pay for that success. Our victories were small, but they gave us hope we could cling to as the war raged on.",
    "11246569": "Rommel's tactics were unpredictable and reckless, but even the Allies claimed to admire him. They seemed to want him to be seen as a formidable opponent.\\r\\n\\nI still don't know whether that was an excuse for their losses or to amplify their glory when they finally defeated him.",
    "11246570": "The desert treated both sides of the war equally harshly.\\r\\n\\nSandstorms brought our equipment to a standstill. Sickness depleted our ranks. What few wells hadn't been sabotaged by one side or the other provided barely enough water to survive the sweltering heat.\\r\\n\\nThe Germans put on theatre shows to distract the soldiers. The British drank their tea and played chess.\\r\\n\\nBoth armies' resources were stretched too thin. Every drop of fuel was precious and the fox became a scavenger.",
    "11246571": "Among the equipment captured by the Australians was a novel the Germans had used to pass coded information from a spy in Cairo.\\r\\n\\nThe spy escaped but with the keys to Rommel's intelligence in their hands, the British could at last see a way to defeat the Germans.\\r\\n\\nBut first, we had to face the Desert Fox at El Alamein.",

    "11263293": "After the armistice between Italy and the Allies was announced on the 8th of September 1943, the Germans executed Operation Achse and attacked their former comrades all across Italy. This galvanized the anti-fascist movements in Italy into open, armed resistance.",

    "11263296": "Italy: Defend Potenza",
    "11263297": "Potenza's location overlooking one of the major passes through the mountains made it an important strategic target. Once the Allies had secured it, retaking it and slowing the Allied advance became a priority for the German forces.",

The Germans destroyed buildings to create roadblocks and cover. The Canadians responded by developing tactics such as \"mouse-holing\" where they assaulted German positions by attacking through the walls of buildings rather than go around them. Though the battle lasted only a week the brutality of the fighting, and ruin of the city earned it the name \"Italian Stalingrad\" among those who fought there.",

    "11263330": "Ortona was the Eastern anchor along the coast for the Gustav Line. It also provided a port for ever more Allied troops and supplies to make their way onto the Italian mainland. Keeping it out of Allied hands was key to the German defense of the region.",

    "11263348": "The British Began to refer to Rommel as \"The Desert Fox.\" For some, the name conjured up images of a wily commander using stealth and cunning to outwit his opponents. But the British had the upper hand at Gazala. They were convinced that more troops and a strong defensive position would keep the Fox at bay.",
    "11263349": "We kept fighting. It was all we could do. But it was as though Rommel could read our minds. He seemed to always be one step ahead. The atmosphere in the British camp became tense. Tempers were frayed. And I was beginning to feel like I'd joined a lost cause.",
    "11263350": "Opportunities to take the fight to Rommel were rare, and we seized them whenever they appeared. Even when we were able to push the Germans back, they made us pay for that success. Our victories were small, but they gave us hope we could cling to as the war raged on.",
    "11263351": "Rommel's tactics were unpredictable and reckless, but even the Allies clamied to admire him. They seemed to want him to be seen as a formidable opponent. I still don't know whether that was an excuse for their losses or to amplify their glory when they finally defeated him.",
    "11263352": "The desert treated both sides of the war equally harshly. Sandstorms brought our equipment to a standstill. Sickness depleted our ranks. What few wells hadn't been sabotaged by one side or the other provided barely enough water to survive the sweltering heat. The Germans put on theatre shows to distract the soldiers. The British drank their tea and played chess. Both armies' resources were stretched too thin. Every drop of fuel was precious and the Fox became a scavenger.",
    "11263353": "Among the equipment captured by the Australians was a novel the Germans had used to pass coded information from a spy in Cairo. The spy escaped but with the keys to Rommel's intelligence in their hands, the British could at least see a way to defeat the Germans. But first, we had to face the Desert Fox at El Alamein.",
