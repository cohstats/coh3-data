    "11246564": "After years of violent struggle against the Italian colonizers, Libya became a battlefield once again in 1940 when Italian forces clashed with the British and their allies.\\r\\n\\nThen in February 1941, the F\u00fchrer sent one of his favourite commanders, Erwin Rommel, to lead the newly formed Deutsches Afrikakorps. He was to help the Italians defend against the British. That was all.\\r\\n\\nLess than a year later, the British were in retreat and Rommel was driving the Afrikakorps towards Benghazi. And my home.",
    "11246565": "We met up with the British forces near Mechili. They were tired but friendly. They had their tea and their porters to make them feel at home, but the war was already taking its toll.\\r\\n\\nWater and food were running low, and the desert was as much their enemy as the Germans were.\\r\\n\\nThe British knew Rommel. He made them nervous. It didn't take long for me to understand why.",
    "11246566": "The British began to refer to Rommel as \"The Desert Fox.\" For some, the name conjured up images of a wily commander using stealth and cunning to outwit his opponents.\\r\\n\\nBut the British had the upper hand at Gazala. They were convinced that more troops and a strong defensive position would keep the Fox at bay.",
    "11246567": "We kept fighting. It was all we could do. But it was as though Rommel could read our minds. He seemed to always be one step ahead.\\r\\n\\nThe atmosphere in the British camp became tense. Tempers were frayed. And I was beginning to feel like I'd joined a lost cause.",
    "11246568": "Opportunities to take the fight to Rommel were rare, and we seized them whenever they appeared.\\r\\n\\nEven when we were able to push the Germans back, they made us pay for that success. Our victories were small, but they gave us hope we could cling to as the war raged on.",
    "11246569": "Rommel's tactics were unpredictable and reckless, but even the Allies claimed to admire him. They seemed to want him to be seen as a formidable opponent.\\r\\n\\nI still don't know whether that was an excuse for their losses or to amplify their glory when they finally defeated him.",
    "11246570": "The desert treated both sides of the war equally harshly.\\r\\n\\nSandstorms brought our equipment to a standstill. Sickness depleted our ranks. What few wells hadn't been sabotaged by one side or the other provided barely enough water to survive the sweltering heat.\\r\\n\\nThe Germans put on theatre shows to distract the soldiers. The British drank their tea and played chess.\\r\\n\\nBoth armies' resources were stretched too thin. Every drop of fuel was precious and the fox became a scavenger.",
    "11246571": "Among the equipment captured by the Australians was a novel the Germans had used to pass coded information from a spy in Cairo.\\r\\n\\nThe spy escaped but with the keys to Rommel's intelligence in their hands, the British could at last see a way to defeat the Germans.\\r\\n\\nBut first, we had to face the Desert Fox at El Alamein.",
