It's customizations were also contained here since there was no attachment list instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An attachment list instance was created and referenced and customizations were moved to said attachment list instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;dummy&quot; parent_animator with a single joint was required as referencing the mesh itself was causing units to visually show either the mesh from the parent_animator or from the attachment list instance at random." />
